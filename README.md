## Contributing

This is the repository for Microsoft Edge **documentation** hosted at [https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/).

If you would like to see new coverage or have feedback, please consider [**contributing**](/CONTRIBUTING.md).  You can edit the existing content, add new content, or simply create new [issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/issues). We'll take a look at your suggestions and will work together to incorporate them into the docs.

Find the data for the [`Status`](https://dev.windows.com/microsoft-edge/platform/status/) page at: https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Status. The `Status` page provides the latest implementation status and future plans for web platform features in Microsoft Edge.

### Conventions

- When adding a page, you must add an entry for it in [toc.md](microsoft-edge/toc.md) for it to appear.
- A folder can contain more folders or `readme.md`s
- Folder/directory names are dash-separated (e.g., `f12-tools`) and lowercase. They are used in URLs on the docs.microsoft.com site. Don't use underscores or PascalCase/camelCase.

### Other text elements

These other text elements have styling available:

* Unordered lists
* Have regular bullets
   * You can also nest bullets.
   * Bullets lists should have more than one entry.
* Pretty standard

1. Ordered lists.
2. Use regular ol' western-style numbering.
3. Should be used only when a list truly has order.

_________________________

Horizontal rules are available. We suggest using them sparingly to reduce clutter.
Do not combine  horizontal rules with heading tags; some already used line styles for visual hierarchy.

### Displaying code

You can use inline `code` Markdown syntax (with the backticks).

Or you can display blocks of code like so:

```css
body {
    background: #fff;
}
```

### Tables

| You can     | use headers | on tables    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------:|
| Left-aligned| Unless a #  | 456          |
| Text value  | More text   | $0.00        |

### Notes

Use notes sparingly. They are blocks designed to highlight "don't-miss-it" information.

We have four different versions of notes currently styled:
- NOTE
- WARNING
- TIP
- IMPORTANT

Respectively, those look like:

![Note patterns](./media/notes.png)

```
> [!WARNING]
> Hello. Yes. I am a warning note that has been automagically created. My text may wrap to more than one line when the Markdown is parsed, but I must include all my information within a single (sometimes very long line) in the Markdown itself.```

For multi-line blockquote notes, use a > in front of each line of the notes as seen in the example below.

```


### Images

Images should be stored in a `media` folder and referenced with a relative path:

`![Note patterns](media/notes.png)`
