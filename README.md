## Contributing

This repo, `edge-developer`, is the repository for the source Markdown files for the Microsoft Edge Developer documentation.  The resulting rendered documentation is hosted at [Microsoft Edge documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/developer/).  This repo also includes the hub page for the Microsoft Edge Enterprise documentation and the Microsoft Edge Developer documentation.  The source files for the Microsoft Edge Enterprise documentation aren't in this repo, but are in the [Edge-Enterprise](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Edge-Enterprise) repo.

If you want to include new coverage or have feedback, consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).  You can edit the existing content, add new content, or report new [issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/issues).  The Microsoft Edge team reviews a look at your suggestions and works to incorporate the suggestions into the docs.

For the latest implementation status and future plans for web platform features in Microsoft Edge, see [Microsoft Edge Platform Status](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/status). For the data that's used to populate the above status site, see [https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Status](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Status).


### File names and directories

*  When adding a webpage (an article implemented as a .md file), you must add an entry for the new webpage in [toc.yml](microsoft-edge/toc.yml), for the article to appear in the Table of Contents.

*  A directory can contain more directories or `readme.md` files.

*  Folder/directory names are dash-separated (for example, `f12-tools`) and lowercase.  Directories are used in URLs on the `learn.microsoft.com` site.  Avoid using underscores, PascalCase, or camelCase.
