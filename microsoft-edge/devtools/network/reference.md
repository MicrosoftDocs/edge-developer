1. Double-click a screenshot thumbnail to zoom-in and view the screenshot.
 
1. Press **Esc** to close the screenshot viewer.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Replay XHR request
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#replay-xhr -->

To replay an XHR request:

1. Go to a webpage, such as the [Network tool reference Demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-network-reference/), in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, select the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

   In the **Network** tool's **Requests** table, rows appear for:
   * `devtools-network-reference/` (`index.html`)
   * `style.css`
   * `script.js`

1. In the demo webpage, click the **Send an XHR request** button.

   In the **Network** tool's **Requests** table, a `data.json` row is added.  The **Initiator** column reads `script.js:20`.

1. In the **Requests** table, right-click the `data.json` request, and then select **Replay XHR**.<!-- no "Replay fetch" menuitem -->

   Or, select the request, and then press **R**.

   In the **Network** tool's **Requests** table, a second `data.json` row is added.  The **Initiator** column reads **Other**:

   ![Click Replay XHR](./reference-images/selecting-replay-xhr.png)

For information about initiators, see:
* [Display initiators and dependencies](#display-initiators-and-dependencies), below.
* [Log network activity](./index.md#log-network-activity) in _Inspect network activity_.

After you click the demo's **Send an XHR request** button (which causes JavaScript to send a request), the **Copy stack trace** menuitem appears in the right-click > **Copy** menu for requests.  See [Copy network requests to the clipboard](#copy-network-requests-to-the-clipboard), below.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Change loading behavior
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#change_loading_behavior -->


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Emulate a first-time visitor by disabling the browser cache
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#disable-cache -->

To emulate how a first-time user experiences your site, turn on the **Disable cache** checkbox.  DevTools disables the browser cache.  This feature more accurately emulates a first-time user's experience, because requests are served from the browser cache on repeat visits.

The **Disable Cache** checkbox:

![The Disable Cache checkbox](./reference-images/disable-cache-checkbox.png)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Disable the browser cache from the Network conditions tool
<!-- Disable the browser cache from the Network conditions drawer  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#disable-cache-network-conditions -->

From the **Network** tool, you can open the **Network conditions** tool in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools, and then disable the browser cache from there:

1. In the **Network** tool, click the **More network conditions** (![More network conditions icon](./reference-images/more-network-conditions-icon.png) button.  The **Network conditions** tool opens in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools.

1. In the **Network conditions** tool, select the **Disable cache** checkbox:

   ![The Network Conditions tool in the Quick View panel, with the 'Disable cache' checkbox selected](./reference-images/network-conditions-cache.png)

See also:
* [Network conditions tool](../network-conditions/network-conditions-tool.md)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Manually clear the browser cache
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#clear-cache -->

To manually clear the browser cache at any time, right-click anywhere in the **Requests** table, and then select **Clear browser cache**:

![The 'Clear browser cache' right-click command](./reference-images/clear-browser-cache-menu.png)

See also:
* [TODO app](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/demo-to-do/)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Emulate offline
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#offline -->

A class of web apps, named [Progressive Web Apps](../progressive-web-apps/index.md) (PWA), are able to function offline with the help of **service workers**.<!-- [service workers](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) --> You may find it useful to quickly simulate a device that has no data connection, when you are building this type of app.

To simulate an offline network experience, select the **No throttling** dropdown menu > **Presets** > **Offline**.

The **Offline** dropdown menu:

![The Offline dropdown menu](./reference-images/offline-dropdown.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Emulate slow network connections
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#throttling -->

To emulate fast 4G, slow 4G, or 3G, select the corresponding preset from the **Throttling** dropdown menu in the action bar at the top:

![The Throttling dropdown menu](./reference-images/throttling-menu.png)

You can choose from different presets, such as:
* **Fast 4G**
* **Slow 4G**
* **3G**
* **Offline**

To add your own custom presets, click the **Throttling** menu, and then select **Custom** > **Add**.

A warning icon is displayed on the **Network** tool's tab, to remind you that throttling is enabled:

![The Throttled warning icon on the Network tab in the Activity Bar](./reference-images/throttled-icon.png)

See also:
* [Simulate a slower network connection](../network/index.md#simulate-a-slower-network-connection) in _Inspect network activity_.
* [TODO app](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/demo-to-do/)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Create a custom throttling profile
<!-- Create custom throttling profiles  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#throttling-profile -->

In addition to presets, such as slow or fast 4G, you can also add your own custom throttling profiles.

To create a custom throttling profile:

1. Go to a webpage, such as the [Inspect Network Activity](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/) demo page, in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. Select the **Network** tool.

1. In the **Throttling** menu, in the **Custom** section, select **Add**.

   Or, select **Customize and control DevTools** > **Settings** > **Throttling**.

   The DevTools **Settings** page opens, with the **Throttling** page selected.

1. In the **Network throttling profiles** section, click the **Add profile** button.

   Example values are shown below, and are used in the next section.

1. In the **Profile Name** text box, enter **10kbps**.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Throttle WebSocket connections
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#throttle-websocket -->
<!-- todo: test these steps and re-create pngs -->

In addition to HTTP requests, DevTools can throttle WebSocket connections.  We'll use the slow custom throttling profile that's created in the previous section, to show the effect of a throttled WebSocket connection on your webpage.

To observe WebSocket throttling:

1. Do the steps in the previous section, [Create a custom throttling profile](#create-a-custom-throttling-profile).

1. Go to a page that uses WebSockets, such as [Online WebSocket Tester](https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester), in a new window or tab.

1. On the page, establish the WebSocket connection.
    
   If you use the **Online WebSocket Tester** webpage, click the **Connect** button.

   If you don't create a PieSocket account to get an API Token, the webpage displays "Connection Established - {"error":"Unknown api key"}".

   If you create a PieSocket account to get an API Token, the webpage simply displays "Connection Established".

1. Right-click the webpage and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, in the **Network** tool, in the **Throttling** dropdown menu, select **Custom** > **10kbps**.

   That option was created in the previous section, [Create a custom throttling profile](#create-a-custom-throttling-profile).

1. In the **Online WebSocket Tester** webpage, in the message text box, delete **DevTools no throttling**, and enter **DevTools with throttling**.

1. In the **Online WebSocket Tester** webpage, click the **Send** button.

   The console within the **Online WebSocket Tester** webpage displays **DevTools with throttling**.

1. At the top of the **Network** tool, select the **Socket** filter button (shown below).
    
1. In the table, click your connection name, such as **channel_123?api_key=...**.

   Tabs appear.

1. Select the **Messages** tab (shown below).

   The WebSocket messages that were sent between the client and server appear.

   The **Time** column shows when messages were received or sent.  These time values reflect the throttled network connection.

   <!-- end new -->

![Messages sent and without throttling](./reference-images/messages-with-without-throttling.png)<!-- todo: update -->

<!--
Optional: To get red down-arrow messages (echoed from the server), as well as green up-arrow messages:

1. Create an account at the PieSocket site.  This creates an API Token.

1. Create a cluster at the PieSocket site.

1. In the **PieSocket** dashboard page, click the **Test online** button.

   The [Online WebSocket Tester](https://piehost.com/websocket-tester) page opens, with your query parameters.

1. Click the **Connect** button.
-->


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Emulate slow network connections from the Network Conditions tool
<!-- Emulate slow network connections from the Network conditions drawer  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#throttling-network-conditions -->

From the **Network** tool, you can open the **Network conditions** tool in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools, and then throttle the network connection from there:

1. In the **Network** tool, click the **More network conditions** (![The 'More network conditions' icon](./reference-images/more-network-conditions-icon.png)) button.  The **Network conditions** tool opens in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools.

1. In the **Network conditions** tool, in the **Network throttling** menu, select a connection speed.

#### Override the user agent
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#user-agent -->

To manually override the user agent:

1. In the **Network** tool, click the **More network conditions** (![More network conditions icon.](./reference-images/more-network-conditions-icon.png) button.  The **Network conditions** tool opens in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools.

1. In the **Network conditions** tool, clear the **Use browser default** checkbox.  The other controls become available.

1. Select a user agent option from the menu, or enter a custom user agent in the text box.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Set user agent client hints
<!-- downstream only section -->

If your site employs user agent client hints and you want to test them, you can set them either in the **Network conditions** tool or in [Emulate mobile devices (Device Emulation)](../device-mode/index.md).

To set user agent client hints in the **Network conditions** tool:

1. In the **Network** tool, click the **More network conditions** (![The 'More network conditions' icon.](./reference-images/more-network-conditions-icon.png) button.  The **Network conditions** tool opens in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools.

1. In the **User agent** section, clear the **Use browser default** checkbox, and then expand **User agent client hints**:

   ![Setting user agent client hints](./reference-images/network-conditions-user-agent-client-hints.png)

1. In the **User agent** dropdown list, select a predefined browser and device.  Or, accept the default value of **Custom...**, and enter information in the **Enter a custom user agent** text box.

1. For either choice (predefined or custom), specify user agent client hints as follows:
   * **Brand** and **Version** such as *Edge* and *92*.  To add multiple brand/version pairs, click **+ Add Brand**.
   * **Full Browser Version** such as *92.0.1111.0*.
   * **Platform** and **Version** such as *Windows* and *10.0*.
   * **Architecture** such as *x86*.
   * **Device model** such as *Galaxy Nexus*.

   You can set or change any of the user agent client hints; there are no required values.

1. Select **Update**.

1. To verify changes, click **Console** and type `navigator.userAgentData`.  Expand the results as needed to view changes to user agent data.

* [User-Agent Client Hints](../../web-platform/user-agent-guidance.md#user-agent-client-hints) in _Detecting Microsoft Edge from your website_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Search requests
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#search -->

To search across request headers, payloads, and responses:

1. In the **Network** tool, click the **Search** (![Search icon](./reference-images/search-icon.png)) button.  Or, press **Ctrl+F** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+F** (macOS).

   The **Search** tab opens on the left side of the **Network** tool.

1. In the **Find** text box, enter your query string, and then press **Enter**.

   Optionally click the **Match case** button to turn on case sensitivity.  Optionally click the **Regular expression** button to turn on regular expressions.

1. Click one of the search results.  The **Network** tool highlights in yellow the request that matched.  The **Network** tool also opens the **Headers** or **Response** tab and highlights the string that matched there, if any.

![The Search tab on the right in the Network tool](./reference-images/search-requests.png)
<!-- https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/ -->

To refresh search results, in the **Search** tab, click the **Refresh** (![Refresh icon](./reference-images/refresh-search-icon.png)) button.

To clear search results, in the **Search** tab, click the **Clear search** (![Clear search icon](./reference-images/clear-search-icon.png)) button.

For more information on all the ways you can search in DevTools, see [Find source files for a page using the Search tool](../search/search-tool.md)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Filter requests
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#filter - upstream section empty; below is like https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-130#network-filters -->

You can filter requests by properties, by type, or by time, and you can hide data URLs.  The **More filters**<!-- constant label; tooltip varies --> dropdown list contains the following options and status checkmarks:
* **Hide data URLs**
* **Hide extension URLs**
* **Blocked response cookies**
* **Blocked requests**
* **3rd-party requests**

![The "Show only/hide requests" dropdown list](./reference-images/show-only-hide-requests-dropdown-list.png)

The dropdown list has a number on the left that tells you how many filters are selected within the dropdown list.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Filter requests by properties
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#filter-by-property -->

Use the **Filter** text box to filter requests by properties, such as the domain or size of the request.

If the text box isn't displayed, the **Filters** pane is probably hidden; see [Hide the Filters pane](#hide-the-filters-pane), below.

The **Filter** text box:

![The Filter text box](./reference-images/filter-text-box.png)

To invert your filter, select the **Invert** checkbox next to the **Filter** box.

You can use multiple properties simultaneously by separating each property with a space.  For example, `mime-type:image/png larger-than:1K` displays all PNGs that are larger than 1 kilobyte.  The multi-property filters are equivalent to `AND` operations.  `OR` operations aren't supported.

The complete list of supported properties:

| Property | Details |
|:--- | :--- |
| `cookie-domain` | Show the resources that set a specific cookie domain. |
| `cookie-name` | Show the resources that set a specific cookie name. |
| `cookie-path` | Show the resources that set a specific cookie path. |
| `cookie-value` | Show the resources that set a specific cookie value. |
| `domain` | Only display resources from the specified domain.  You can use a wildcard character (`*`) to include multiple domains.  For example, `*.com` displays resources from all domain names ending in `.com`.  DevTools populates the autocomplete dropdown menu with all of the domains that are found. |
| `has-overrides` | Show requests that have overridden content, headers, any overrides (yes), or no overrides (no). You can add the corresponding Has overrides column to the request table. |
| `has-response-header` | Displays the resources that contain the specified HTTP response header.  DevTools populates the autocomplete dropdown menu with all of the response headers that are found. |
| `is` | Use `is:running` to find `WebSocket` resources. |

#### Filter requests by type
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#filter-by-type -->

<!-- horiz list -->
To filter requests by request type, click the buttons on the **Network** tool: **All**, **Fetch/XHR**, **Doc**, **CSS**, **JS**, **Font**, **Img**, **Media**, **Manifest**, **WS** (WebSocket), **Wasm** (WebAssembly), or **Other** (any other type not listed here).

If the buttons don't appear, the **Filters** pane might be hidden.  See [Hide the Filters pane](#hide-the-filters-pane), below.

To enable multiple type filters simultaneously, press and hold **Ctrl** (Windows, Linux) or **Command** (macOS) and then click the filters.

![Using the Type filters to display JS, CSS, and Document resources](./reference-images/type-filters.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Filter requests by time
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#filter-by-time -->

Click and drag left or right on the **Overview** pane to only display requests that were active during that time frame.  The filter is inclusive.  Any request that was active during the highlighted time is shown.

Filtering out any requests that were inactive around 300 ms:

![Filtering out any requests that were inactive around 300 ms](./reference-images/overview-filter.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Hide data URLs
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#hide_data_urls -->

[Data URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) are small files embedded into other documents.  Any request that displays in the **Requests** table that starts with `data:` is a data URL.

To hide the requests, turn off the **Hide data URLs** checkbox:

![The Hide Data URLs checkbox](./reference-images/hide-data-urls.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Hide extension URLs
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#hide-extension-urls -->

To focus on the code you author, you can filter out irrelevant requests sent by extensions you may have installed in Microsoft Edge.  Extension requests have URLs that start with `chrome-extension://`.

To hide extension requests, in the **Filters** action bar, select the **More filters** dropdown menu, and then select **Hide extension URLs** so that a checkmark appears next to it:

![Extension URLs hidden from the **Requests** table](./reference-images/extension-urls-hidden.png)<!-- better would be "5 / 10 requests" instead of "5 requests" -->
<!-- https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/ -->

The status bar at the bottom displays the number of the shown requests out of the total, such as **5 / 10 requests**.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Show only the requests with blocked response cookies
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#show-blocked-cookies -->

To filter out everything except the requests with response cookies blocked for any reason, in the **Filters** action bar, select the **More filters** dropdown list, and then select **Blocked response cookies** so that a checkmark appears next to it.

Then, to find out why a response cookie was blocked, select the request (under **Name**), open its **Cookies** tab (to the right), and then hover over the information (![Information icon](./reference-images/information-icon-for-blocked-response-cookies.png)) icon.

For example:

1. In Microsoft Edge, select **Settings and more** > **New InPrivate window**.

1. In the Address bar, enter **Microsoft.com**.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. Select the **Network** tool.

1. Make sure the **All** filter button is selected.

1. Refresh the webpage.

   Many messages are listed in the **Network** tool.

1. In the **Filters** action bar, select the **More filters** dropdown list, and then select **Blocked response cookies**.

   In the menu, a checkmark appears next to **Blocked response cookies**.

1. Click outside the dropdown list to close it.

   Requests that have blocked response cookies are displayed, such as **id?d_visid_ver=...**.

1. Select a request, such as **id?d_visid_ver=...**.

   The sidebar opens, with tabs.

1. Select the **Cookies** tab.

1. Hover over the info (![Info icon](./reference-images/info-icon-blocked-response-cookies.png)) icon.

   The tooltip reads, for example: "This attempt to set a cookie via a Set-Cookie header was blocked due to user preferences."

   ![The **Requests** table shows only the requests with blocked response cookies](./reference-images/blocked-response-cookies.png)

   The status bar at the bottom displays the number of the shown requests out of the total.

Additionally, the **Network** tool shows a warning icon (![Warning icon](./reference-images/warning-icon-cookies-blocked.png)) next to a request with cookies blocked either because of Edge flags or configuration.  Hover over the icon to see a tooltip with a clue and click it to go to the **Issues** tool for more information.

<!-- ![Warning icons next to a request blocked by Edge flags or configuration](./reference-images/3pc-blocked.png) -->


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Show only blocked requests
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#show-blocked -->

To filter out everything except blocked requests, in the **Filters** action bar, select **More filters** > **Blocked requests**, so that a checkmark appears.  To test this, you can use the **Network request blocking** tool in the **Quick View** panel at the bottom of DevTools; see [Block requests](./index.md#block-requests) in _Inspect network activity_.

For example:

1. Go to a webpage, such as the [Inspect Network Activity](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/) demo page, in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, select the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

   The **Requests** table lists `.html`, `.css`, `.png`, and `.js` files.

1. In the **More filters** dropdown list (with tooltip of **Show only/hide requests**), select **Blocked requests**.

   In the dropdown list, a checkmark is displayed next to **Blocked requests**.

1. Click outside of the dropdown list, to close it.

   The **Requests** table is empty, because DevTools is not blocking any requests, and requests are now filtered to only show blocked requests.

1. Press **Esc** once or twice, so that the **Quick View** panel is open at the bottom of DevTools.

1. In the **Quick View** toolbar, click the **More tools** (![More tools icon](./reference-images/more-tools-icon-quick-view.png)) button, and then select **Network request blocking**.

   The **Network request blocking** tool opens in the **Quick view** panel.

1. In the **Network request blocking** tool, click the **Add network request blocking pattern** (!["Add network request blocking pattern" icon](./reference-images/add-network-request-blocking-pattern-icon.png)) button.

1. In the **Text pattern to block matching requests** text box, enter **\*.png**, and then click the **Add** button.

   **\*.png** is listed, with a checkmark.

   In the **Network** tool, the **Requests** table is still empty, because no requests have been actively blocked yet.

1. Refresh the webpage.

   ![The **Requests** table shows only blocked requests](./reference-images/blocked-requests.png)

   * In the demo webpage, instead of an Edge logo next to the heading, a broken-image icon is shown, along with the image's alt-text (**The Microsoft Edge DevTools logo**).

   * In the **Network** tool, the **Requests** table lists `.png` files, only.  The **Requests** table highlights blocked requests as red text.

   * In the **Network** tool, the status bar at the bottom displays the number of the shown requests out of the total, such as **2 / 5 requests**.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Show only third-party requests
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#third-party -->

To filter out everything except the requests with origin that differs from page origin, in the **Filters** action bar, select **More filters** > **3rd-party requests**, so that a checkmark appears.  Try it on the [Inspect Network Activity](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/) demo page.

![The **Requests** table shows only the third-party requests](./reference-images/third-party-requests.png)

The status bar at the bottom displays the number of the shown requests out of the total.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Sort requests
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#sort_requests -->

By default, the requests in the **Requests** table are sorted by initiation time, but you can sort the table using other criteria.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Sort by column
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#sort-by-column -->

Click the header of any column in the **Requests** to sort requests by that column.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Sort by activity phase
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#sort-by-activity -->
<!-- Waterfall column was formerly on by default, as shown throughout upstream -->

The **Waterfall** column is off by default.  To turn on the **Waterfall** column: right-click a **Requests** table header, and then select the plain **Waterfall** menuitem that doesn't have a submenu.

To change how the **Waterfall** column sorts requests:

* Right-click the header of the **Requests** table, click **Waterfall**, and then select one of the following options:

   * **Start Time** - The first request that was initiated is placed at the top.
   
   * **Response Time** - The first request that started downloading is placed at the top.
   
   * **End Time** - The first request that finished is placed at the top.
   
   * **Total Duration** - The request with the shortest connection settings and request or response is placed at the top.
   
   * **Latency** - The request that waited the shortest time for a response is placed at the top.
      
These descriptions assume that each respective option is ranked from shortest to longest.  Click the header of the **Waterfall** column to reverse the order.

The following shows sorting the Waterfall by total duration.  The lighter portion of each bar is time spent waiting and the darker portion is time spent downloading bytes:

![Sorting the Waterfall by total duration](./reference-images/waterfall-total-duration.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Analyze requests
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#analyze -->

So long as DevTools is open, it logs all requests in the **Network** tool.  Use the **Network** tool to analyze requests.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display a log of requests
<!-- View a log of requests  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#requests -->

Use the **Requests** table to display a log of all requests made while DevTools has been open.  To reveal more information about each item, click or hover on requests.

![The **Requests** table](./reference-images/requests-table.png)

The **Requests** table displays the following columns by default:

- **Name**. The file name of the resource, or an identifier for the resource.
- **Status**. The HTTP status code.
- **Type**. The MIME type of the requested resource.
- **Initiator**. The following objects or processes can initiate requests:
  - **Parser**. The HTML parser.
  - **Redirect**. An HTTP redirect.
  - **Script**. A JavaScript function.
  - **Other**. Some other process or action, such as navigating to a page via a link or entering a URL in the Address bar.
- **Size**. The combined size of the response headers plus the response body, as delivered by the server.
- **Time**. The total duration, from the start of the request to the receipt of the final byte in the response.
- **Fulfilled by**. Whether the request was fulfilled by the HTTP cache or the app's service worker.

The **Waterfall** column is off by default.  To turn on the The **Waterfall** column, right-click a **Requests** table header, and then select the plain **Waterfall** menuitem that doesn't have a submenu.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add or remove columns
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#columns -->

Right-click the header of the **Requests** table and select a column name to hide or show it.  The currently displayed columns have checkmarks next to them.

![Adding a column to the **Requests** table](./reference-images/requests-add-column.png)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add custom columns for response headers
<!-- Add custom columns https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#custom-columns -->

To add a custom column to the **Requests** table:

1. Right-click the header of the **Requests** table and then select **Response Headers** > **Manage Header Columns**.

   The **Manage Header Columns** popup window opens.

1. Click the **Add custom header** button, enter the custom header name, and then click **Add**. 

   ![Adding a custom column to the **Requests** table](./reference-images/requests-add-custom-column.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Group requests by inline frames
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#group-by-frames -->

If inline frames on a page initiate a lot of requests, you can make the request log friendlier by grouping them.

To group requests by iframes:

1. Go to a webpage, such as the [Network tool reference Demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-network-reference/), in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, select the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

   In the **Network** tool's **Requests** table, rows appear for:
   * `devtools-network-reference/` (`index.html`)
   * `style.css`
   * `script.js`

1. In the demo webpage, click the **Load iframes** button.

   Many rows are added in the **Requests** table:

   ![The network request log with requests not grouped](./reference-images/network-request-log-iframes-initial.png)

1. In the **Network** tool, click the **Network settings** (![Settings icon](./reference-images/network-settings-icon.png)) button, and then select the **Group by frame** checkbox.

   In the **Requests** table, expandable frame names are displayed.

1. In the **Requests** table, click an expander triangle on a frame.

   The requests that were initiated by the inline frame are displayed:

   ![The network request log with requests grouped by iframes](./reference-images/network-request-log-iframes.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display the timing relationship of requests
<!-- View the timing of requests in relation to one another  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#waterfall -->

Use the **Waterfall** column of the **Requests** pane to view the timing relationships of requests.  The default organization of the **Waterfall** column uses the start time of the requests.  So, requests that are farther to the left started earlier than the requests that are farther to the right.

The **Waterfall** column is off by default.  To turn on the The **Waterfall** column, right-click a **Requests** table header, and then select the plain **Waterfall** menuitem that doesn't have a submenu.

To see the different ways that you can sort the Waterfall, see [Sort by activity phase](#sort-by-activity-phase), above.

   The filtered list of requests is empty.

1. In the Online Websocket Tester webpage, click the **Connect** button.

   If you haven't set up an account and API Token, the page displays:

   * **Connection Established**
   * **{"error":"Unknown api key"}** with a triangle pointing down; sent from the server to the browser.

   In the **Network** tool, in the **Messages** tab, the request is displayed:

   * **channel_123?api_key=...**

1. In the list of requests, select the WebSocket connection, such as **channel_123?api_key=...**.

   The sidebar opens, with tabs.

1. Select the **Messages** tab.

   If you didn't register for an API Token, the **Messages** tab lists the message:

   * **{"error":"Unknown api key"}** with a red down-arrow; sent from the server to the browser.

1. In the Online Websocket Tester webpage, in the text box, change **Hello PieSocket!** to **Hello world!**, and then click the **Send** button.

   In the webpage, the console shows the message **Hello world!** with a triangle pointing up; sent from the browser to the server.

   In the **Network** tool, in the **Messages** tab, the table shows the last 100 messages; in this case, the message is added:

   * **Hello world!** with a green up-arrow; sent from the browser to the server:

![The Messages tab](./reference-images/messages-tab.png)


Note: To get red down-arrow messages (echoed from the server), as well as green up-arrow messages, you would need to:

1. Create an account at the PieSocket site.  This creates an API Token.

1. Create a cluster at the PieSocket site.

1. In the **PieSocket** dashboard page, click the **Test online** button.

1. Click the **Connect** button.


To refresh the **Requests** table, in the **Name** pane, click the name of the WebSocket connection again.

The **Requests** table contains the following three columns:

*  **Data**.  The message payload.  If the message is plain text, it is displayed here.  For binary opcodes, this column displays the name and code of the opcode.  The following opcodes are supported: 
   * Continuation Frame
   * Binary Frame
   * Connection Close Frame
   * Ping Frame
   * Pong Frame

*  **Length**.  The length of the message payload, in bytes.

*  **Time**.  The time when the message was received or sent.

<!-- no coloring now
Messages are color-coded according to each type:

*  Outgoing text messages are light-green.
*  Incoming text messages are white.
*  WebSocket opcodes are light-yellow.
*  Errors are light-red.
-->

   ![The Headers panel](./reference-images/resources-headers.png)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### View HTTP header source
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#header-source -->

By default, the **Headers** tab shows header names alphabetically.  To display the HTTP header names in the order they were received:

<!-- setup steps, not in upstream: -->

1. Go to a webpage that uses XHR, such as [Removing -ms-high-contrast and embracing standards-based forced colors in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/06/30/removing-ms-high-contrast-and-embracing-standards-based-forced-colors-in-microsoft-edge/), in a new window or tab.

1. Accept cookies in the banner prompt, if it appears.

   In regions where General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is enforced, this site shows a cookie banner, and won't send a `collect` request (below) unless you accept cookies in the banner.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

See also:
* [Display HTTP headers](#display-http-headers), above.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Provisional headers warning
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#provisional-headers -->

Sometimes the **Headers** tab shows the warning message **Provisional headers are shown.**  This may be due to the following reasons:

* The request wasn't sent over the network, but was served from a local cache, which doesn't store the original request headers.
* The network resource isn't valid.
* Due to security reasons.

Suppose the request wasn't sent over the network but was served from a local cache, which doesn't store the original request headers.  In this case, you can select the **Disable cache** checkbox at the top of the **Network** tool, to see the full request headers.  For example:

1. Go to the [Inspect Network Activity](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/) demo page.

1. Right-click the webpage and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. Select the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

1. Select the **getstarted.js** network request.

   The **Request Headers** section displays the message: **Provisional headers are shown.  Disable cache to see full headers.**

   ![Provisional headers warning message](./reference-images/provisional-headers-warning.png)

1. Select the **Disable cache** checkbox at the top of the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

1. Select the **getstarted.js** network request.

   The **Request Headers** section no longer displays the message; the full request headers are shown.

See also:
* [Emulate a first-time visitor by disabling the browser cache](#emulate-a-first-time-visitor-by-disabling-the-browser-cache), above.

<!-- upstream, omit:
As another case, suppose the network resource isn't valid.  For example, execute `fetch("https://jec.fish.com/unknown-url/")` in the **Console** tool:

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### View request payload (query string parameters and form data)
<!-- View request payload  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#payload -->

To view an HTTP request's payload (query string parameters and form data), select a request from the **Requests** table and then select the **Payload** tab in the sidebar, as follows:

1. Go to a webpage, such as the [Network tool reference Demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-network-reference/), in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, select the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

   In the **Network** tool's **Requests** table, rows appear for:
   * `devtools-network-reference/` (`index.html`)
   * `style.css`
   * `script.js`
   * `favicon.png`

1. In the demo webpage, click the **Send form data** button.

   In the **Network** tool's **Requests** table, a row is added:

   * `form-data-endpoint?hasfile=true`

1. Select the row `form-data-endpoint?hasfile=true`.

   The sidebar opens, including a **Payload** tab.

1. Select the **Payload** tab.

   The request's payload is displayed, including a **Query String Parameters** section and a **Form Data** section:

  ![The Query String Parameters section in the Payload tab](./reference-images/resources-headers-query-string-parameters.png)<!-- copy 2 of png is below -->

In the **Console** tab of DevTools is the error:

* `POST https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-network-reference/form-data-endpoint?hasfile=true 405 (Method Not Allowed) (anonymous) @ script.js:49`

This harmless **Method Not Allowed** error appears in the **Console**, because there's no `form-data-endpoint` POST handler on the demo server.  The error is expected, because github.io hosting doesn't run application servers, only static files.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### View payload source
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#payload-source -->

By default, the **Network** tool shows the payload in a human-readable form.

To instead view the sources of query string parameters or form data:

1. Do the steps in the previous section, above.

   In the **Payload** tab, the **Query String Parameters** section shows the payload in a human-readable form, for `hasfile`.  The **Form Data** section show the payload in a human-readable form, for `username`, `timestamp`, and `file`:

   ![The View source buttons](./reference-images/resources-headers-query-string-parameters-2.png)<!-- copy of png, adds red boxes on "View source" button -->

1. Next to the **Query String Parameters** section heading, click the **View source** button.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Timing breakdown phases explained
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#timing-explanation -->

Each of these phases may appear in the **Timing** tab:

- **Queueing**. The browser queues requests when any of the following are true
  - There are higher priority requests.
  - There are already six TCP connections open for this origin, which is the limit. Applies to HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 only.
  - The browser is briefly allocating space in the disk cache.

- **Stalled**. The request could be stalled for any of the reasons described in **Queueing**.

- **DNS Lookup**. The browser is resolving the IP address for the request.

- **Initial connection**. The browser is establishing a connection, including TCP handshakes and retries and negotiating a Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

- **Proxy negotiation**. The browser is negotiating the request with a [proxy server](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server).

- **Request sent**. The request is being sent.

- **ServiceWorker Preparation**. The browser is starting up the service worker.

- **Request to ServiceWorker**. The request is being sent to the service worker.

- **Waiting (TTFB)**. The browser is waiting for the first byte of a response. TTFB stands for _Time To First Byte_. This timing includes one round trip of latency and the time the server took to prepare the response.

- **Content Download**. The browser is receiving the response.

- **Receiving Push**. The browser is receiving data for this response via HTTP/2 Server Push.

- **Reading Push**. The browser is reading the local data that was previously received.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display initiators and dependencies
<!-- View initiators and dependencies  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#initiators-dependencies -->

To display the initiators and dependencies of a request, hold **Shift** and hover on the request in the **Requests** table.

*  The requests that initiated the hovered request are shown in green.
*  The dependencies of the hovered requests are shown in red.

![Displaying the initiators and dependencies of a request](./reference-images/resources-initiators-dependencies.png)

When the **Requests** table is ordered chronologically, if you hover on a line, the line preceding it displays a green request.  The green request is the initiator of the dependency.  If another green request is displayed on the line before that, that higher request is the initiator of the initiator.  And so on.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display load events
<!-- View load events  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#load -->

DevTools displays the timing of the `DOMContentLoaded` and `load` events in multiple places on the **Network** tool:

* In the **Overview** pane with vertical lines.

* In the **Waterfall** column of the Request table with vertical lines.  The **Waterfall** column is off by default.  To turn on the The **Waterfall** column, right-click a **Requests** table header, and then select the plain **Waterfall** menuitem that doesn't have a submenu.

* In the **Summary** pane, at the bottom of the **Network** tool, with timing labels.

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is colored blue, and the `load` event is red.

![The locations of the DOMContentLoaded and load events on the Network tool](./reference-images/load-events.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display the total number of requests
<!-- View the total number of requests  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#total-number -->

The total number of requests is listed in the **Summary** pane, at the bottom of the **Network** tool.

![The total number of requests since DevTools were opened](./reference-images/total-requests.png)

Caution: This number only tracks requests that have been logged since DevTools was opened.  If other requests occurred before DevTools was opened, those requests aren't counted.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display the total download size
<!-- View the total size of transferred and loaded resources  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#total-size -->

The total download size of requests is listed in the **Summary** pane, at the bottom of the **Network** tool.

![The total download size of requests](./reference-images/total-download-size.png)

Caution: This number only tracks requests that have been logged since DevTools was opened.  If other requests occurred before DevTools was opened, the previous requests aren't counted.

To verify how large resources are after the browser uncompresses each item, see [display the uncompressed size of a resource](#display-the-uncompressed-size-of-a-resource).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Display the stack trace that caused a request
<!-- View the stack trace that caused a request  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#initiator-stack-trace -->

After a JavaScript statement requests a resource, hover on the **Initiator** column to display the stack trace leading up to the request.

![The stack trace leading up to a resource request](./reference-images/requests-initiator-stack.png)

<!-- [codepen.io/contoso/pen/yLBrOWa?editors=0010#0](https://codepen.io/contoso/pen/yLBrOWa?editors=0010#0) -->

#### Display the uncompressed size of a resource
<!-- View the uncompressed size of a resource  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#uncompressed -->

To see both the transferred size and the uncompressed size of a resource at the same time:

1. In the upper right within the **Network** tool, click the **Network settings** (gear) icon.  A row of checkboxes appears.

1. Turn on the **Big request rows** checkbox.

1. Examine the **Size** column in the Request table. The top value is the transferred size, and the bottom value is the size of the resource after the browser uncompresses it:

   ![An example of uncompressed resources](./reference-images/requests-uncompressed-compare.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Export requests data
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#export -->

You can export or copy the list of requests, with filters applied, in several ways described next.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Save all network requests to a HAR file
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#save-as-har -->

HAR (HTTP Archive) is a file format used by several HTTP session tools to export the captured data.  The format is a JSON object with a particular set of fields.  See [HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/).

To reduce the chances of accidental leaks of sensitive information, by default you can export the "sanitized" network log in HAR format that excludes sensitive information such as `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, and `Authorization` headers.  If required, you can also export the log _with_ sensitive data.

To save all network requests to a HAR file, without sensitive data:

1. Go to a webpage, such as the [Inspect Network Activity](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/) demo page, in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, select the **Network** tool.

1. Refresh the webpage.

1. Right-click any request in the **Requests** table, and then select **Copy** > **Copy all as HAR (sanitized)**:

   ![Selecting 'Save all listed as HAR (sanitized)'](./reference-images/selecting-copy-as-har.png)

   Or, in the action bar at the top of the **Network** tool, click the **Export HAR (sanitized)** (![Export HAR (sanitized) icon](./reference-images/export-har-sanitized-icon.png)) button.

<!-- older para: -->
DevTools saves all requests that have occurred since you opened DevTools to the HAR file.

<!-- older para: -->
You can't filter requests, and you can't save a single request.


To save all network requests to a HAR file, including sensitive data:

1. In DevTools, select **Customized and control DevTools** > **Settings**.

   The **Settings** > **Preferences** page opens.

1. Scroll down to the **Network** section.

1. Select the checkbox **Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data**.

1. Click the **Close** (![Close Settings button](./reference-images/close-settings-button.png)) button.

1. In the **Network** tool, right-click any request in the **Requests** table, and then select **Copy** > **Copy all as HAR (with sensitive data)**.

   Or, in the action bar at the top, click the **Export HAR (either sanitized or with sensitive data)** (![Export HAR icon](./reference-images/export-har-sanitized-icon.png)) button, and then select **Export HAR (with sensitive data)**:

   ![Selecting 'Copy all as HAR (with sensitive data)'](./reference-images/export-har-button.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Import a HAR file into DevTools for analysis
<!-- bottom of https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#save-as-har -->

After you have a HAR file, you can import it back into DevTools for analysis by using [HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/).

To import a HAR file into DevTools for analysis:

* In the action bar at the top of the **Network** tool, click the **Import HAR file** (![Import HAR file icon](./reference-images/import-har-file-icon.png)) button.

* Or, drag the HAR file onto the **Requests** table.

The **Network** tool reads and shows initiators for the requests that are imported from the HAR file.  For initiators, see [Display a log of requests](#display-a-log-of-requests), above.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Copy network requests to the clipboard
<!-- Copy a request, a filtered set of requests, or all of them to the clipboard  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#copy -->
