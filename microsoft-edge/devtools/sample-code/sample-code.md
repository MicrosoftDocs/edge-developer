## Start the localhost server

If you start the localhost server from a specific demo folder, such as `\Demos\demo-to-do`, and then go to `localhost:8080` (or simply open the local file such as `C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\Demos\demo-to-do\index.html` in Microsoft Edge), the specific demo immediately is displayed in the browser.  You can then add just the specific demo directory, such as `C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\Demos\demo-to-do\`, to the **Workspace** tab of the **Sources** tool.  You then have full functionality for using DevTools as an IDE, for that specific demo.

Starting the server from within a specific demo directory:

```
$ cd ~/GitHub/Demos/demo-to-do
$ npx http-server
```

Example directory to add to the **Workspace** tab of the **Sources** tool: `C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\Demos\demo-to-do`

Result of going to `localhost:8080`:

![Server started from the \Demos\demo-to-do directory](./sample-code-images/server-started-from-a-demo-dir.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Starting the localhost server from the Demos directory

If you start the localhost server from within the entire `\Demos\` folder and then go to `localhost:8080`, you can navigate to each demo from within the browser.  You can add the entire cloned `/Demos/` folder to the **Workspace** tab of the **Sources** tool.  You then have full functionality for using DevTools as an IDE.

Starting the server from within the entire `\Demos\` directory:

```
$ cd ~/GitHub/Demos
$ cd "C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\Demos"  # alt syntax
$ npx http-server
```

Example directory to add to the **Workspace** tab of the **Sources** tool: `C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\Demos`

Result of going to `localhost:8080`:

![Server started from /demos/ directory instead of a specific demo subdirectory](./sample-code-images/server-started-from-demos-dir.png)

## URL patterns for rendered demo webpages and source code

Most of the Readme files in the Demos repo have a link that opens the rendered `.html` file from the GitHub.io server.  Sometimes you have a URL for an HTML source file at GitHub.com, but instead you need to derive the **github.io** server URL to display the rendered file, rather than displaying the code listing of the `.html` source code in the GitHub directory.

To convert from the URL for the source code directory at GitHub.com to the URL for a rendered demo webpage at GitHub.io, the pattern is as follows.

Suppose the URL for the webpage's source code at GitHub.com is:
* `https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/demo-to-do/`

The key components of that GitHub.com URL are:
* `https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/tree/main/[path]`

In contrast, the desired GitHub.io URL pattern is:
* `https://[org].github.io/[repo]/[path]`

To fill in that GitHub.io URL pattern, in this example:
*  [org] is `MicrosoftEdge`.
*  [repo] is `Demos`.
*  [path] is `demo-to-do`.

Therefore, the resulting GitHub.io server URL for the rendered demo webpage is:
* `https://MicrosoftEdge.github.io/Demos/demo-to-do/`

These URLs aren't case-sensitive.

When you run a localhost server and start it within a cloned repo folder, such as `C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\Demos\workspaces`, you typically see `localhost:8080` in the browser Address Bar.
