# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 134)

These are the latest features in the Stable release of Microsoft Edge DevTools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Forced reflow in the Performance Insights sidebar

<!-- Subtitle: View the top function call and its total reflow time in your performance trace. -->

The **Performance Insights** sidebar includes a new section called **Forced Reflow**.  This insight highlights the most time-consuming function call, showing its total reflow time and related stack traces.  By clicking on this insight, you can see the function call and its stack trace highlighted in the **Main** frame:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Heap snapshot statistics account for every byte  

<!-- Subtitle: View a memory allocation pie chart of your heap snapshot under Statistics-->

Previously, when you took a heap snapshot in the **Memory** tool, the **Statistics** pie chart didn't show every byte that's in the categories, resulting in blank parts of the chart:

To fix this, two new catch-all categories have been added, to account for the rest of the bytes in the heap snapshot:
* **Other JS objects**
* **Other non-JS objects (such as HTML and CSS)**

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Simplified DevTools Themes menu

<!-- Subtitle: Change the DevTools theme by clicking Customize and control DevTools > Themes, and then select Light or Dark. -->

The theme options have been simplified by removing the redundant nesting options.  When you go to **Customize and control DevTools** > **Themes**, the options have been simplified to **System preference**, **Light**, and **Dark**:
