## Memory tool reports backing store sizes as part of an object's shallow size

<!-- Subtitle: New experiment is available to make Shallow Size column in the Memory tool more helpful. -->

Microsoft Edge 123 adds a new experiment called **In heap snapshots, treat backing store size as part of the containing object**.  If you enable this experiment, the **Memory** tool reports shallow sizes in a way that more closely matches JavaScript behavior.  By enabling this experiment, containers and their contents can now be represented as a single item, such as:
* An `Object` and its properties.
* An `Array` and its contents.
* A `Map` and its contents.
* A `Set` and its contents.

For example, to find the largest arrays, you can sort `Array`â€‹ instances by shallow size, as shown below.

Default behavior for heap snapshots:
![Heap snapshot default behavior](./devtools-123-images/heap-snapshot-default.png)

Heap snapshots with the new experiment enabled:
![Heap snapshot with experiment enabled](./devtools-123-images/heap-snapshot-with-experiment.png)

This experiment is helpful because heap snapshots in the Memory tool show a complete list of everything allocated in the V8 and Blink heaps.  Sometimes that list is a little too fine-grained, breaking out an item as if it is multiple items.  For example, the list in the heap snapshot represents each JavaScript `Array` instance separately from the contents of that `Array`, which are called `(object elements)[]`. However, in JavaScript code, an `Array` is a single entity, rather than an array instance and separate contents of the array.

## Crash analyzer tool is available by default

<!-- Subtitle: The Crash analyzer tool has been moved out of DevTools Experiments and is available in More Tools on the Activity Bar. -->

The **Crash analyzer** tool is now available by default, and is no longer an experiment that needs to be enabled.  To open the **Crash analyzer** tool, in the **Activity Bar**, click the **More tools** (+) menu, and then select **Crash analyzer**.

The **Crash analyzer** tool helps you create a JavaScript stack trace, and applies your sourcemaps to the stack trace so that you can debug faster:

## Command Palette experimental feature has been removed

<!-- Subtitle: The Command Palette experiment has been removed. -->

The Command Palette experimental feature has been removed from Microsoft Edge, starting with version 123.

## Undocked DevTools window is kept focused as the topmost window while inspecting a page

<!-- Subtitle: In recent versions of Microsoft Edge, the undocked DevTools window lost focus while you're inspecting a webpage. The DevTools window now stays in focus as the topmost window. -->

When DevTools was undocked into its own separate window, and you selected a webpage element to inspect, the DevTools window lost focus and was obscured by the webpage being analyzed.  This bug has been resolved, and the DevTools window stays in focus as the topmost window.
