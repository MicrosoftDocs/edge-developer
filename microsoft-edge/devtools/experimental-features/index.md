# Experimental features in Microsoft Edge DevTools

<!-- 
Policies to keep this page comprehensive and maintainable:

First, update all sections re:
   * This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Canary 123.
b/c that may add new sections.
After that, update all sections re:
   * This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Stable 123.

*  Favor Canary over Stable re: sequencing.
*  Include a visible h2 section for every checkbox that's in public-facing Microsoft Edge DevTools > Experiments page.  If no info, write a tautology as a starting point.  Add as needed, each month.
*  Keep h2 sections in same order as DevTools > Settings > Experiments.
*  In the heading and UI steps, keep the checkbox label UI string as it appears in the UI; do not revise or "fix" it.
*  Don't change h2 text, that might break a link from UI.
*  When a checkbox is removed from all the channels, remove its h2 section.

Steps to maintain this page monthly: For latest Canary, and for latest Stable:
1. Go to edge://settings/help, update if needed.
2. In DevTools, select Settings > Preferences > Restore Defaults > Reload DevTools.
3. In DevTools, go to Settings > Experiments.
4. Make sure the article has an h2 for each checkbox.
5. In each h2 section, update the presence or absence of "not present", and update the version #:
This checkbox is|is not present in Microsoft Edge Canary 140.
This checkbox is|is not present in Microsoft Edge Stable 138.
6. Find old version #'s, inspect.
-->

Microsoft Edge DevTools provide access to experimental features that are still in development.  This article lists and describes the experimental features that are in either:
*  The latest version of the Canary preview channel of Microsoft Edge.
*  The latest version of the Stable release of Microsoft Edge.

All [channels of Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-channels) have experimental features. You can get the latest experimental features by using the [Microsoft Edge Canary channel](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download/insider). To view the full list of experiments that are available in your version of Microsoft Edge, see the **Settings** > **Experiments** page in DevTools.

<!-- no Warning formatting, because UI already contains red "WARNING" at top -->
These experiments could be unstable or unreliable and may require you to restart DevTools.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable new Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) replacing previous contrast ratio and AA/AAA guidelines
<!-- checkbox has no "(?)" link pointing to this anchor wording -->

The [Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA)](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/methods/Method-font-characteristic-contrast.html) replaces the [AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref#contrast-minimum)/[AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref#contrast-enhanced) guidelines contrast ratio in the Color Picker.  The Color Picker is used in the **Styles** tab in the **Elements** tool.

APCA is a new way to compute contrast.  It is based on modern research on color perception.  Compared to AA/AAA guidelines, APCA is more context-dependent.  The contrast is calculated based on the following spatial properties of the text, color, and context.

*  Spatial properties of text that include font weight and size.
*  Spatial properties of color that include perceived contrast between text and background.
*  Spatial properties of context that include ambient light, surroundings, and intended purpose.

## Performance panel: show postMessage dispatch and handling flows
<!-- checkbox has no "(?)" link pointing to this anchor wording -->

_new as of Microsoft Edge 124_

This experiment improves the **Performance** tool's **Main** section to help you quickly identify `postMessage` events and handlers, by distinguishing events that are triggered by the `postMessage` method from other events that are displayed in the **Performance** tool.  This experiment helps you investigate performance issues that are related to posting messages across various threads of an application, to view messages between windows, iframes, and dedicated workers.

Without this experiment, events that are triggered by dispatching and handling messages between threads of an application appear as generic scripting function-call events.  With this experiment enabled:
* `postMessage` dispatch events appear as **Schedule postMessage**.
* `postMessage` handler events appear as **On Message**:

!["Schedule postMessage" events and "On Message" events in the Performance tool](./index-images/post-message-events.png)

This experiment helps you investigate when a `postMessage` call occurred, and how long the message was queued before the `postMessage` handler starts.  The dispatch events are linked to handler events by initiator arrows that appear when you click on either type of event:

## Open source files in Visual Studio Code
<!-- checkbox has a "(?)" link
https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools/experimental-features/#open-source-files-in-visual-studio-code
pointing to this anchor wording -->

The **Open source files in Visual Studio Code** experiment replaces the code editor of the Sources tool with Visual Studio Code, for editing local files. When you turn on this experiment, Developer Tools detects when you edit a local file, and prompts you to select a folder to use as your Workspace.

When you select a folder to use as your Workspace, selecting any link to a file in DevTools opens the file in Visual Studio Code.  In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, this action opened the file in the code editor of the Sources tool in DevTools.

![Selecting a file link in the Styles tool opens the file in Visual Studio Code](./index-images/experiment-sources-in-code-editor-open.png)

Any edits that you make in DevTools now change the file on the hard drive and sync live with Visual Studio Code.
