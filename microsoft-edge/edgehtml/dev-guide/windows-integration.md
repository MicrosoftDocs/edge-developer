# Windows integration features  

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../includes/legacy-edge-note.md)]  

## Payment Request API  

The [Payment Request API](./windows-integration/payment-request-api.md) is an open, cross-browser standard that enables browsers to act as an intermediary between merchants, consumers, and the payment methods \(such as credit cards\) that consumers have stored in the cloud.  

## Web Authentication and Windows Hello  

The [Web Authentication API](./windows-integration/web-authentication.md) in Microsoft Edge enables web applications to use [Windows Hello](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/comprehensive-security) biometrics for user authentication.  

## Web Notifications API  

The [Web Notifications API](./windows-integration/web-notifications-api.md) allows websites to send users notifications outside the context of the Microsoft Edge browser.
