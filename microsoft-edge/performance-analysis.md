# Performance Analysis

## New to Performance? [Start with F12.](./f12-devtools-guide.md)
The [F12 tools](./f12-devtools-guide.md) built into Microsoft Edge can be used to analyze the general performance of a web site. It provides similar (but more limited) capabilities to the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) from right within the browser.

## Looking to dig deep? [Try the Windows Performance Toolkit.](./performance-analysis/windows-performance-toolkit.md)
The Microsoft Edge team uses the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) for analyzing browser performance. WPT was created by the Windows team to conduct in-depth program performance analysis. It straddles the boundaries between website JavaScript and Microsoft Edge native code, allowing both to be viewed within the same tool. WPT can be used to:
 - Measure CPU time taken for software to complete work
 - Calculate the memory allocated by software
 - Show the details of downloading files from remote servers
 - Measure frame rate.
 Here's how to [investigate website performance using the Windows Performance Toolkit](./performance-analysis/windows-performance-toolkit.md).
