# Use Service Workers to manage network requests and push notifications

Service Workers are a special type of Web Worker with the ability to intercept, modify, and respond to all network requests using the `Fetch` API.  Service Workers can access the `Cache` API, and asynchronous client-side data stores, such as `IndexedDB`, to store resources.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Registering a Service Worker

Similar to other Web Workers, Service Workers must exist in a separate file. You reference this file when registering the Service Worker, as shown in the following code:

```javascript
if ( "serviceWorker" in navigator ) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register( "/serviceworker.min.js" );
}
```

Modern browsers provide different levels of support for Service Workers. As such, it's a good practice to test for the existence of the `serviceWorker` object before running any Service Worker-related code. In the above code, a Service Worker is registered using the `serviceworker.min.js` file located at the root of the site.

Make sure to place the Service Worker file in the highest-level directory that you want it to manage.  Such a directory is called the _scope_ of the Service Worker.  In the previous code, the file is stored in the root, and the Service Worker manages all pages in the domain.

If the Service Worker file was stored in a `js` directory, the scope of the Service Worker would be the `js` directory and any subdirectories.  As a best practice, place the Service Worker file in the root of your site, unless you need to reduce the scope of your Service Worker.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## The Service Worker lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Service Worker consists of multiple steps, with each step triggering an event. You can add listeners to these events to run code to perform an action. The following list presents a high-level view of the lifecycle and related events of Service Workers.

1.  Register the Service Worker.

1.  The browser downloads the JavaScript file, installs the Service Worker, and triggers the `install` event. You can use the `install` event to pre-cache any important and long-lived files, such as CSS files, JavaScript files, logo images, offline pages, and so on from your website.

    ```javascript
    self.addEventListener( "install", function( event ){
        console.log( "WORKER: install event in progress." );
    });
    ```

1.  The Service Worker is activated, which triggers the `activate` event.  Use this event to clean up outdated caches.

    ```javascript
    self.addEventListener( "activate", event => {
        console.log('WORKER: activate event in progress.');
    });
    ```

1.  The Service Worker is ready to run when the page is refreshed or when the user goes to a new page on the site. If you want to run the Service Worker without waiting, use the `self.skipWaiting()` method during the `install` event, as follows:

    ```javascript
    self.addEventListener( "install", event => {
        self.skipWaiting();
        // â€¦
    });
    ```

1.  The Service Worker is now running.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Using fetch in Service Workers

The main event that you use in a Service Worker is the `fetch` event.  The `fetch` event runs every time the browser attempts to access content within the scope of the Service Worker.

The following code shows how to add a listener to the fetch event:

```javascript
self.addEventListener( "fetch", event => {
  console.log('WORKER: Fetching', event.request);
});
```

Within the `fetch` handler, you can control whether a request goes to the network, pulls from the cache, and so on.  The approach you take will likely vary, based on the type of resource being requested, how frequently it is updated, and other business logic that's unique to your application.

Here are a few examples of what you can do within the `fetch` handler:

*   If available, return a response from the cache; otherwise, fallback to requesting the resource over the network.
*   Fetch a resource from the network, cache a copy, and return the response.
*   Allow users to specify a preference to save data.
*   Supply a placeholder image for certain image requests.
*   Generate a response directly in the Service Worker.

## Push Notifications

Service Workers can push notifications to users.  Push notifications can prompt users to re-engage with your application after time has elapsed.  To learn more, see [Re-engage users with badges, notifications, and push messages](./notifications-badges.md).
