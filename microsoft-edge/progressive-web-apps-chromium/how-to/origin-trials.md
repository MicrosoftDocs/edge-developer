# Experimental features and origin trials

Some of the PWA features in Microsoft Edge are still experimental. Experimental features can be used in two ways:

*   By enabling the corresponding flag in Microsoft Edge.
*   By enrolling your site in an origin trial to test features in production with your users.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Toggle experimental features

To turn experimental features on or off:

1.  Open Microsoft Edge.
1.  Go to `edge://flags`.
1.  Navigate to the relevant experiment.
1.  Select the dropdown menu next to the experiment description and select **Enabled** to turn on the feature or **Disabled** to turn it off.

## Enroll your site in an origin trial

Microsoft Edge sometimes uses origin trials to test features for specific domains or websites. You may want to use an origin trial for your website to apply a specific feature. If you're a website owner, you can enroll in an origin trial. An origin trial provides features to a percentage of Microsoft Edge users who visit your website.

For more information about Origin Trials, see [Microsoft Edge Origin Trials Developer Console](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials).
