# Handle files in Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps that can handle files feel more native to users and better integrated in the operating system.

Websites can already let users upload files by [using the `<input type="file">` or drag and drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications), but PWAs go one step further and can register as file handlers on the operating system.

When a PWA is registered as a file handler for certain file types, the operating system can automatically launch the app when those files are opened by the user, similar to how Microsoft Word handles `.docx` files.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable the File Handling API

The File Handling feature is experimental.

To enable the File Handling feature:

1.  Go to `edge://flags` in Microsoft Edge.
1.  Select **Search flags** and type "file handling API".
1.  Select **Default** > **Enabled** > **Restart**.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Define which files your app handles

The first thing to do is to declare which types of files your app handles. This is done in your app [manifest file](./web-app-manifests.md), using the `file_handlers` array member.

Each entry in the `file_handlers` array needs to have two properties:

*  `action`: The URL the operating system should navigate to when launching your PWA.
*  `accept`: An object of accepted file types. Keys are MIME-types (partial types, using the wildcard symbol `*`, are accepted), and values are arrays of accepted file extensions.

Consider the following example:

```json
{
    "file_handlers": [
        {
            "action": "/openFile",
            "accept": {
                "text/*": [
                    ".txt"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, the app registers a single file handler for that accepts text files. When a `.txt` file is opened by the user by, for example, double-clicking its icon on the desktop, then the operating system launches the app using the `/openFile` URL.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Detect whether the File Handling API is available

Before handling the files, your app needs to check whether the File Handling API is available on the device and browser.

To check whether the File Handling API is available, test whether the `launchQueue` object exists, as follows:

```javascript
if ('launchQueue' in window) {
    console.log('File Handling API is supported!');
} else {
    console.error('File Handling API is not supported!');
}
```


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Handle files on launch

When your app is launched by the OS after a file was opened, you can use the `launchQueue` object to access the file content.

Use the following JavaScript code to process the text content:

```javascript
if ('launchQueue' in window) {
    console.log('File Handling API is supported!');

    launchQueue.setConsumer(launchParams => {
        handleFiles(launchParams.files);
    });
} else {
    console.error('File Handling API is not supported!');
}

async function handleFiles(files) {
    for (const file of files) {
        const blob = await file.getFile();
        blob.handle = file;
        const text = await blob.text();

        console.log(`${file.name} handled, content: ${text}`);
    }
}
```

The `launchQueue` object queues all the launched files until a consumer is set with `setConsumer`. To learn more about the `launchQueue` and `launchParams` objects, go to the [File Handling explainer](https://github.com/WICG/file-handling/blob/main/explainer.md#launch).

## Demo

My Tracks is a PWA demo app that uses the File Handling feature to handle `.gpx` files. To try the feature with this demo app:

*  [Enable the feature](#enable-the-file-handling-api) in Microsoft Edge.
*  Go to [My Tracks](https://captainbrosset.github.io/mytracks/) and install the app.
*  Download a GPX file on your computer. You can use this [test GPX file](https://www.visugpx.com/download.php?id=okB1eM4fzj).
*  Open the downloaded GPX file.

Notice that the app launches automatically and that Microsoft Edge requests your permission to handle this file.

:::image type="content" source="../media/my-tracks-allow-file-handling.png" alt-text="The 'Open file?' permission request dialog.":::

If you allow the app to handle the file, a new entry appears in the app's sidebar, and you can click the checkbox next to it to visualize the corresponding GPS track.

The source code for this app can be accessed on the [My Tracks GitHub repository](https://github.com/captainbrosset/mytracks).

* The [manifest.json](https://github.com/captainbrosset/mytracks/blob/main/mytracks/manifest.json) source file uses the `file_handlers` array to request handling `.gpx` files.
* The [file.js](https://github.com/captainbrosset/mytracks/blob/main/src/file.js) source file uses the `launchQueue` object to handle incoming files.
