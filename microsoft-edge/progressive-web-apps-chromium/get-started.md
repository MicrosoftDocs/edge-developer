# Get started with Progressive Web Apps (Chromium)  

Progressive Web Apps \(PWAs\) are web apps that are [progressively enhanced][WikiProgressiveEnhancement].  The progressive enhancements include app-like features, such as installation, offline support, and push notifications.  You may also package your PWA for app stores.  Possible app stores include the Microsoft Store, Google Play, Mac App Store, and more.  The Microsoft Store is the commercial app store built into Windows 10.  

The following guide gives you an overview of PWA basics by creating a simple web app and extending it as a PWA.  The finished project works across modern browsers.  

> [!TIP]
> You may use [PWABuilder][PwaBuilder] to create a new PWA, enhance your existing PWA, or package your PWA for app stores.  

## Prerequisites  

*   Use [Visual Studio Code][VisualstudioCodeMain] to edit your PWA source code.  
*   Use [Node.js][NodejsMain] as your local web server.  
    
## Create a basic web app  

To create an empty web app, follow the steps in [Node Express App Generator][ExpressjsApplicationGenerator], and name your app `MySamplePwa`.  

In the prompt, run the following commands.  

```shell
npx express-generator --no-view
```  

```shell
npm install
```  

The commands create an empty web app and install any dependencies.  

You now have a simple, functional web app.  To start your web app, run the following command.  

```shell
npm start
```  

Now browse to `http://localhost:3000` to view your new web app.

:::image-end:::  

## Get started building a PWA  

Now that you have a simple web app, extend it as a PWA by adding the three requirements for PWAs<!--[3 requirements for PWAs][ArchiveMicrosoftEdgeLegacyDeveloperPWAsIndexRequirements]-->: [HTTPS](#step-1---use-https), a [Web App Manifest](#step-2---create-a-web-app-manifest), and a [Service Worker](#step-3---add-a-service-worker).  

### Step 1 - Use HTTPS  

Key parts of the PWA platform, such as [Service Workers][MDNServiceWorkerApi], require the use of HTTPS.  When your PWA goes live, you must publish it to an HTTPS URL.  

For debugging purposes, Microsoft Edge also permits `http://localhost` to use the PWA APIs.  

[Publish your web app as a live site][VisualStudioNodejsTutorialPublishAzureAppService], but make sure your server is configured for HTTPS.  For example, you may create an [Azure free account][AzureCreateFreeAccount].  Host your site on the [Microsoft Azure App Service][AzureWebApps] and it is served over HTTPS by default.  

The following guide, use `http://localhost` to build your PWA.  

### Step 2 - Create a Web App Manifest  

A [Web App Manifest][MDNWebAppManifest] is a JSON file containing metadata about your app, such as name, description, icons, and more.  

To add an app manifest to the web app:  

1.  In Visual Studio Code, choose **File** > **Open Folder** and choose the `MySamplePwa` directory you created earlier.  
1.  Select `Ctrl`+`N` to create a new file, and paste in the following code snippet.  
    
    ```json
    {
        "lang": "en-us",
        "name": "My Sample PWA",
        "short_name": "SamplePWA",
        "description": "A sample PWA for testing purposes",
        "start_url": "/",
        "background_color": "#2f3d58",
        "theme_color": "#2f3d58",        
        "orientation": "any",
        "display": "standalone",
        "icons": [
            {
                "src": "/icon512.png",
                "sizes": "512x512"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```  
    
1.  Save the file as `/MySamplePwa/public/manifest.json`.  
1.  Add a 512x512 app icon image named `icon512.png` to `/MySamplePwa/public/images`.  You may use the [sample image](./media/progressive-web-app.png) for testing purposes.  
1.  In Visual Studio Code, open `/public/index.html`, and add the following code snippet inside the `<head>` tag.  
    
    ```html
    <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
    ```   
    
### Step 3 - Add a Service Worker  

Service workers are the key technology behind PWAs, enabling scenarios like offline support, advanced caching, and running background tasks previously limited to native apps.  

Service workers are background tasks that intercept network requests from your web app.  Service workers attempt to complete tasks, even when your PWA is not running.  Tasks include the following actions.  

*   Serving requested resources from a cache  
*   Sending push notifications  
*   Running background fetch tasks  
*   Badging icons  
*   and more  
    
Service workers are defined in a special JavaScript file.  For more information, navigate to [Using Service Workers][MDNUsingServiceWorkers] and [Service Worker API][MDNServiceWorkerApi].  

To build a service worker in your project, use the **Cache-first network** service worker recipe.  

1.  Copy the source files [pwabuilder-sw-register.js][PwaBuilderServiceWorkerRegisterJS] and [pwabuilder-sw.js][PwaBuilderServiceWorkerJS] to the `public` folder in your web app project.
    
    *   `pwabuilder-sw-register.js`  
    *   `pwabuilder-sw.js`  

1.  In Visual Studio Code, open `/public/index.html` and add the following code snippet inside the `<head>` tag.  
    
    ```html
    <script type="module" src="/pwabuilder-sw-register.js"></script>
    ```  
    
Your web app now has a service worker that uses the cache-first strategy.  The new service worker fetches resources from the cache first, and from the network only as needed.  Cached resources include images, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

Use the following steps to confirm that your service worker runs.  

1.  Navigate to your web app using `http://localhost:3000`.  If your web app is not available, run the following command.   
    
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
    
1.  In Microsoft Edge, select `F12` to open the Microsoft Edge DevTools.  Select **Application**, then **Service Workers** to view the service workers.  If the service worker is not displayed, refresh the page.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/devtools-sw-overview.png" alt-text="Microsoft Edge DevTools Service Worker overview" lightbox="./media/devtools-sw-overview.png":::
       Microsoft Edge DevTools Service Worker overview  
    :::image-end:::  
    
1.  View the service worker cache by expanding **Cache Storage** and select **pwabuilder-precache**.  All of the resources cached by the service worker should be displayed.  The resources cached by the service worker include the app icon, app manifest, CSS, and JavaScript files.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/devtools-cache.png" alt-text="Service Worker cache in Microsoft Edge DevTools" lightbox="./media/devtools-cache.png":::
       Service Worker cache in Microsoft Edge DevTools \(F12\)  
    :::image-end:::  
    
1.  Try your PWA as an offline app.  In Microsoft Edge DevTools \(`F12`\), choose **Network** then change the **Online** status to **Offline**.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/devtools-offline.png" alt-text="Setting app to offline mode in Microsoft Edge DevTools" lightbox="./media/devtools-offline.png":::
       Setting app to offline mode in Microsoft Edge DevTools  
    :::image-end:::  
    
1.  Refresh your app and it should display the offline mechanism for serving the resources of your app from the cache.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/visual-studio-nodejs-express-index.png" alt-text="PWA running offline" lightbox="./media/visual-studio-nodejs-express-index.png":::
       PWA running offline  
    :::image-end:::  
    
## Add push notifications to your PWA  

You may create PWAs that support push notifications by completing the following tasks.  

1.  Subscribe to a messaging service using the [Push API][MDNPushApi]  
1.  Display a toast message when a message is received from the service using the [Notifications API][MDNNotificationsApi]  
    
Just like with Service Workers, the push notification APIs are standards-based APIs.  The push notification APIs work across browsers, so your code should work everywhere that PWAs are supported.  For more information about delivering push messages to different browsers on your server, navigate to [Web-Push][NPMWebPush].  

The following steps have been adapted from the Push Rich Demo in [Service Worker Cookbook][ServiceWorkerCookbookPushRichDemo] provided by Mozilla, which has many useful Web Push and service worker recipes.  

### Step 1 - Generate VAPID keys  

Push notifications require VAPID \(Voluntary Application Server Identification\) keys in order to send push messages to the PWA client.  There are several VAPID key generators available online \(for example, [vapidkeys.com][VapidkeysMain]\).  After generation, you should get a JSON object containing a public and private key.  Save the keys for later steps in the following tutorial.  For information about VAPID and WebPush, navigate to [Sending VAPID identified WebPush Notifications using the Mozilla Push Service][MozillaServicesSendingVapidWebPushNotificationsPush].  

### Step 2 - Subscribe to push notifications  

Service workers handle push events and toast notification interactions in your PWA.  To subscribe the PWA to server push notifications, ensure the following conditions are met.  

*   Your PWA is installed, active, and registered  
*   Your code to complete the subscription task is on the main UI thread of the PWA  
*   You have network connectivity  
    
Before a new push subscription is created, Microsoft Edge verifies if the user granted the PWA permission to receive notifications.  If not, the user is prompted by the browser for permission.  If the permission is denied, the request to `registration.pushManager.subscribe` throws a `DOMException`, which must be handled.  For more on permission management, navigate to [Push Notifications in Microsoft Edge][WindowsBlogsWebNotificationsEdge].  

In your `pwabuilder-sw-register.js` file, append the following code snippet.  

```javascript
// Ask the user for permission to send push notifications.
navigator.serviceWorker.ready
    .then(function (registration) {
        // Check if the user has an existing subscription
        return registration.pushManager.getSubscription()
            .then(function (subscription) {
                if (subscription) {
                    return subscription;
                }
                
                const vapidPublicKey = "PASTE YOUR PUBLIC VAPID KEY HERE";             
                return registration.pushManager.subscribe({
                    userVisibleOnly: true,
                    applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(vapidPublicKey)
                });
            });
    });

// Utility function for browser interoperability
function urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {
    var padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);
    var base64 = (base64String + padding)
        .replace(/\-/g, '+')
        .replace(/_/g, '/');
        
    var rawData = window.atob(base64);
    var outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);
    
    for (var i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {
        outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return outputArray;
}
```  

For more information, navigate to [PushManager][MDNPushManager] and [Web-Push][NPMWebPushUsage].  

### Step 3 - Listen for push notifications  

After a subscription is created in your PWA, add handlers to the service worker to respond to push events.  Push event are sent from the server to display toast notifications.  Toast notifications display data for a received message.  To complete the following tasks, you must add a `click` handler.  

*   Dismiss the toast notification  
*   Open, focus, or open and focus any open windows  
*   Open and focus a new window to display a PWA client page  
    
In your `pwabuilder-sw.js` file, add the following handlers.  

```javascript
// Respond to a server push with a user notification.
self.addEventListener('push', function (event) {
    if (Notification.permission === "granted") {
        const notificationText = event.data.text();
        const showNotification = self.registration.showNotification('Sample PWA', {
            body: notificationText,
            icon: 'images/icon512.png'
        });
        // Ensure the toast notification is displayed before exiting the function.
        event.waitUntil(showNotification);
    }
});

// Respond to the user selecting the toast notification.
self.addEventListener('notificationclick', function (event) {
    console.log('On notification click: ', event.notification.tag);
    event.notification.close();
    
    // This attempts to display the current notification if it is already open and then focuses on it.
    event.waitUntil(clients.matchAll({
        type: 'window'
    }).then(function (clientList) {
        for (var i = 0; i < clientList.length; i++) {
            var client = clientList[i];
            if (client.url == 'http://localhost:1337/' && 'focus' in client)
                return client.focus();
        }
        if (clients.openWindow)
            return clients.openWindow('/');
    }));
});
```  

### Step 4 - Try it out  

To test push notifications for your PWA, complete the following steps.  

1.  Navigate to your PWA at `http://localhost:3000`.  When your service worker activates and attempts to subscribe your PWA to push notifications, Microsoft Edge prompts you to allow your PWA to show notifications.  Select **Allow**.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/notification-permission.png" alt-text="Permission dialog for enabling notifications" lightbox="./media/notification-permission.png":::
       Permission dialog for enabling notifications  
    :::image-end:::  
    
1.  Simulate a server-side push notification.  With your PWA opened at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, select `F12` to open the DevTools.  Choose **Application** > **Service Worker** > **Push** to send a test push notification to your PWA.  
    
    :::row:::
       :::column span="":::
          A push notification should display near the taskbar.  
          
          :::image type="complex" source="./media/devtools-push.png" alt-text="Push a notification from DevTools" lightbox="./media/devtools-push.png":::
             Push a notification from DevTools  
          :::image-end:::  
       :::column-end:::
       :::column span="":::
          If you do not select \(or activate\) a toast notification, the system automatically dismisses it after several seconds and queues it in your Windows Action Center.  
          
          :::image type="complex" source="./media/windows-action-center.png" alt-text="Notifications in Windows Action Center" lightbox="./media/windows-action-center.png":::
             Notifications in Windows Action Center

       :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::
