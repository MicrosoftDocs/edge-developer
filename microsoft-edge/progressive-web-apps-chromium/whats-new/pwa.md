# What's New in Progressive Web Apps

This page lists the updates to PWAs and Web Apps from the Microsoft Edge Web Apps team.  To try new features, review these announcements.  To stay up to date with the latest and greatest features, download the [Microsoft Edge preview channels](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/download).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## What's New in Microsoft Edge 97

Microsoft Edge version 96 is scheduled to become the Stable release on November 18, 2021.  Microsoft Edge version 97 will move from Dev to Beta preview channel following that date.

### Store apps registered as URL handlers hide custom tab UI 

Store-installed PWAs that are participating in the [URL Handler Origin Trial](#url-handlers-origin-trial) will no longer show the Chrome Custom Tab (CCT) when redirecting from the PWA's domain to a matching domain name with a different top-level domain (TLD). This redirecting often happens in apps with locale-specific domains; for example, redirecting from `contoso.com` to `contoso.ca` for users in Canada.

## What's New in Microsoft Edge 96

### URL Protocol Handlers moves to Stable

The origin trial has been concluded.  The URL Protocol Handlers capability is now shipping in Microsoft Edge 96 Stable.

*  [URL protocol handler registration for PWAs](https://web.dev/url-protocol-handler/)

### New hub design for managing your installed web apps

Microsoft Edge Canary reached version 96 on October 5, 2021.  With a subset of our users, we're testing a new design to better manage your installed web apps.  When you go to `edge://apps` in your browser, it now displays a redesigned hub that lists installed PWAs and websites as apps.

#### Sort order

You can sort your apps by any of the following:
*  Recently used.
*  Alphabetically, based on title.
*  Date of installation.

#### List view or grid view

You can arrange apps in a list or grid view, by using the **View as** dropdown.  In this image, **Grid** view is selected:

<!-- lightbox justified because large detailed image -->

#### Pin apps, create shortcuts to apps, run app on login

You can easily pin apps to the taskbar or **Start** menu.  You can create a shortcut, and enable apps to run on user login.

#### App details page

There's now an app details page, which provides way to easily access the following:
*  Permissions and privacy details for the associated origin.
*  More details about the application.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## What's New in Microsoft Edge 95

Microsoft Edge version 95 moved to Beta channel on September 28, 2021.
The origin trials remain active for the following features:
*  [Window Controls Overlay for desktop PWAs](#window-controls-overlay-origin-trials).
*  [URL Handlers](#url-handlers-origin-trial).

We expect the [protocol handlers origin trial](#protocol-handlers-origin-trial) to end on October 21, 2021.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## What's New in Microsoft Edge 94

Microsoft Edge version 94 moved to Stable on September 23, 2021. This release cycle was shortâ€”just<!-- em dash --> 3 weeks from Microsoft Edge 93 Stable to Microsoft Edge 94 Stable, as we snapped to the new [4-week release cycle](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/12/new-release-cycles-microsoft-edge-extended-stable/).  This new release cadence matches the new cadence of Chromium milestones, described in [Speeding up Chrome's release cycle](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html).

Due to the shortened release cycle of Microsoft Edge version 94, we focused on stabilizing the release cycle logistics, and we shifted feature development to Microsoft Edge version 95.

The origin trials remain active for the following features:
*  [Window Controls Overlay for desktop PWAs](#window-controls-overlay-origin-trials).
*  [URL Handlers](#url-handlers-origin-trial).

We expect the [protocol handlers origin trial](#protocol-handlers-origin-trial) to end with Microsoft Edge version 94 as we take final feedback and get ready to move the protocol handlers feature to Stable.  In case you are enrolled in the origin trial for protocol handlers, we plan to end the trial period after Microsoft Edge version 94.  We'll then determine when this feature will become Stable.

## What's New in Microsoft Edge 93

Microsoft Edge version 93 became the Stable channel of Microsoft Edge on September 2, 2021. This article lists updates we made to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) from both a developer and consumer point of view.

### Measure usage of your Store-installed PWA

Microsoft Edge now includes a referrer header with the request for the first navigation of your Microsoft Store-installed PWA.

This feature was first introduced in Microsoft Edge version 91, and we shipped a bug fix in Microsoft Edge version 93.

Learn more in [Publish a Progressive Web App to the Microsoft Store](../how-to/microsoft-store.md#measure-usage-of-your-pwa-installed-from-the-microsoft-store).

### Window Controls Overlay origin trials

To have more control over the title bar area that's currently displayed in standalone display mode, you may want to experiment with Window Controls Overlay. Window Controls Overlay (WCO) is a set of features that work together to provide just the essential controls needed for the app window. This layout frees up more space for the web content layer. WCO is available for installed desktop PWAs.

Learn more about experimenting with Window Controls Overlay at [Experimental features in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](../how-to/window-controls-overlay.md).

Register your origin for the **Web App Window Controls Overlay** trial at our [Origin Trials Developer Console](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/web-app-window-controls-overlay/registration/).

### URL Handlers origin trial

Developers can now use the experimental feature Web App URL Handlers in origin trial. This feature allows the registration of an installed PWA to open links from other apps that refer to its scope.

Learn more about experimenting with URL handlers at [Experimental features in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](../how-to/handle-urls.md).

Register your domain for the **Web App URL Handlers** trial at our [Origin Trials Developer Console](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/web-app-url-handlers/registration/).

### Support for the Share API on macOS

We have implemented support for the `navigator.share` API for macOS. The feature is rolling out to stable Microsoft Edge browsers on macOS over the coming weeks.

Learn more about the [navigator.share() API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## What's New in Microsoft Edge 92

Microsoft Edge version 92 became the stable channel of Microsoft Edge on July 22, 2021. This article lists updates we made to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) from both a developer and consumer point of view.

### Protocol handlers origin trial

You can now register your PWA to handle specific protocols with the host operating system. The Windows trial for protocol handlers is now available. You can register your origin for the **Web App Protocol Handler** trial at the [origin trial signup page](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/web-app-protocol-handler-registration/registration).

Learn more about using protocol handlers with your PWA at [Experimental features in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](../how-to/handle-protocols.md).

### Streamlined App Info menu

When a user selects the ellipses (**...**) button in the app's title bar, the **App info** menu is displayed.  We've updated the **App info** menu and streamlined the user experience in the following ways, to provide a user experience that's more like a desktop app than a browser UI:
*  Moved the app **Publisher** information to the top level and made it the first thing a user sees.

   :::image type="content" source="media/app-info.png" alt-text="The new, streamlined App Info menu":::

*  Moved the privacy information and controls into a dedicated 2nd-level **Privacy** menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/privacy-menu.png" alt-text="Privacy controls in the dedicated Privacy menu.":::

*  Moved content-related tools into a dedicated 2nd-level **More tools** menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/more-tools.png" alt-text="Content-related tools are now found in the More Tools menu.":::

### Post-install flyout dialog box

After a PWA is installed from the Microsoft Edge browser on Windows, users can now select from four options to easily launch their apps:
*  **Pin to taskbar**
*  **Pin to Start**
*  **Create Desktop shortcut**
*  **Auto-start on device login**

For convenience, this flyout dialog box is shown the first time the app is launched.

:::image type="content" source="media/post-install-flyout.png" alt-text="The post-install flyout dialog box with options for Pin to Taskbar, Pin to Start, Create Desktop Shortcut, and Auto-Start on Device Login":::

This feature is being rolled out gradually to all users.  In the meantime, if you'd like to use this feature, go to `edge://flags` and enable the flag **Web Apps Post Install Dialog**.

### Restore Web Apps

Installed sites and PWAs that were running before an unexpected shutdown will now restore (that is, they will be restarted) when the system recovers.

An unexpected shutdown can occur due to process failure, system restart, or power outage. Before this change, installed sites and PWAs had indeterminate behavior upon system restore.
