# Windows integration features

## Payment Request API
The [Payment Request API](./windows-integration/Payment-Request-API.md) is an open, cross-browser standard that enables browsers to act as an intermediary between merchants, consumers, and the payment methods (e.g. credit cards) that consumers have stored in the cloud.

## Web Authentication and Windows Hello
The [Web Authentication API](./windows-integration/web-authentication.md) in Microsoft Edge enables web applications to use [Windows Hello](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624961) biometrics for user authentication.

## Web Notifications API
The [Web Notifications API](./windows-integration/web-Notifications-API.md) allows websites to send users notifications outside the context of the Microsoft Edge browser.
