# Develop for the web with Microsoft Edge

Develop for the web with Microsoft Edge by using Microsoft Edge DevTools, Microsoft Edge extensions, Progressive Web Apps, WebDriver automation, WebView2, and more.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Microsoft Edge DevTools
<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<!-- keep sync'd:
* [Overview of DevTools](devtools-guide-chromium/overview.md) - intro section
* [Microsoft Edge DevTools](../develop-web-microsoft-edge.md#microsoft-edge-devtools) in _Develop for the web with Microsoft Edge_
-->

The Microsoft Edge browser comes with built-in web development tools, called Microsoft Edge DevTools.  DevTools is a set of web development tools that appears next to a rendered webpage in the browser.  DevTools provides a powerful way to inspect and debug webpages and web apps.  You can even edit source files and create website projects, all within the DevTools environment.

With DevTools, you can do the following:

*  Inspect, tweak, and change the styles of elements in the webpage using live tools with a visual interface.  Inspect where the browser stored content to construct the webpage, including `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and `.png` file formats.

*  Emulate how your webpage behaves on different devices and simulate a mobile environment, complete with different network conditions.  Inspect the network traffic and see the location of the problems.

*  Debug your JavaScript using breakpoint debugging and with the live console.  Find memory problems and rendering issues with your web apps.

*  Find accessibility, performance, compatibility, and security issues in your products, and use DevTools to fix the accessibility issues that are found.

*  Use a development environment to sync changes in DevTools with the file system and from the web.

See [Overview of DevTools](devtools-guide-chromium/overview.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Microsoft Edge extensions
   
Create an extension for Microsoft Edge, to add to or modify the browser's features.  Extensions improve the browser experience, to provide a specialized function that's important to a target audience.

You can create a Microsoft Edge extension if you have an idea or product that is based upon either a specific web browser, or improvements to features of specific webpages. Examples of companion experiences include ad blockers and password managers.

A Microsoft Edge extension is structured similarly to a regular web app, and usually includes:

*  An app manifest JSON file that contains basic platform information.
*  A JavaScript file that defines the behavior of the browser extension.
*  HTML and CSS files that define the user interface.

See [Overview of Microsoft Edge extensions](extensions-chromium/index.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps use open web technologies to provide cross-platform interoperability.  They work like native apps on supporting platforms, and like regular websites on other browsers.

Progressive Web Apps combine the best of the web and compiled apps, to provide users an app-like experience, customized for their devices.  A Progressive Web App is a website that's progressively enhanced to function like installed, native apps on supporting platforms, while functioning like regular websites on other browsers.

Progressive Web Apps have a much lower cross-platform development cost than compiled apps that require a specific codebase for each platform, such as a separate codebase for Android, for iOS, and for each desktop operating system.

See [Overview of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](progressive-web-apps-chromium/index.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## WebView2

The WebView2 control is powered by Microsoft Edge, and enables you to embed web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) in your native applications.  Combine the ubiquity of the web platform, with the full capabilities of native platforms.

![Diagram of an app with native UI areas in the left and top left, and WebView2 UI areas in the top right and bottom](./develop-web-microsoft-edge-images/webview-panels.png)

The following diagram shows the spectrum of apps, from maximum reach, to maximum power:

![The spectrum of apps, from maximum reach but less power, to an optimal hybrid blend, to maximum power but less reach](./develop-web-microsoft-edge-images/web-hybrid-native.png)
<!-- png copy used in main article is named "web-native.png" -->

Hybrid apps, in the middle of this spectrum, allow you to enjoy the best of both worlds: the ubiquity and strength of the web platform, combined with the power and full capabilities of the native platform.

See [Introduction to Microsoft Edge WebView2](webview2/index.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Test and automation

The following are tools to automate testing in Microsoft Edge:

*  **DevTools Protocol** is used to instrument, inspect, debug, and profile browsers.
*  Use **Origin Trials** to try experimental APIs.
*  **Playwright** provides cross-browser automation through a single API.
*  **Puppeteer**'s API controls Microsoft Edge via DevTools Protocol.
*  **WebDriver** simulates user interaction with Microsoft Edge.
*  **webhint** linting checks code for errors and best practices.

See [Test and automation in Microsoft Edge](test-and-automation/test-and-automation.md).

## Development tips for Microsoft Edge

There are many tips and tricks to be aware of when building websites or web apps that work in Microsoft Edge, including:

*  Testing for coming changes that could impact compatibility of your website with Microsoft Edge.
*  Moving users to Microsoft Edge from Internet Explorer.
*  Configuring tracking prevention in Microsoft Edge.
*  Detecting Microsoft Edge from your website.
*  Customizing the Password Reveal button.
*  Detecting Windows 11 by using User-Agent Client Hints.

See [Development tips for Microsoft Edge](web-platform/web-platform.md).

## Microsoft Edge IDE integration

Various features of Microsoft tools provide integration of development using Microsoft Edge, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio, to develop your products, webpages, and web apps that use and work with full integration in Microsoft Edge.

See [Microsoft Edge IDE integration](visual-studio-code/ide-integration.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Accessibility in Microsoft Edge

Development of your webpages, web apps, and web-enabled products is robustly supported through the extensive Accessibility features in Microsoft Edge and its tooling ecosystem.

See [Accessibility in Microsoft Edge](accessibility/index.md).

<!-- ## Privacy whitepaper

The Microsoft Edge _browser privacy promise_ provides you with protection, transparency, control, and respect.  Microsoft Edge has many features and services associated with privacy.  This whitepaper explains how your data is used, how to control the different features, and how to manage your collected data.

See [Microsoft Edge Privacy Whitepaper](privacy-whitepaper/index.md).

<!-- ## The Web We Want initiative

The Web We Want initiative is a cross-browser, open initiative focused on identifying missing features and functionalities in the web platform for potential development as web standards or browser features.  Let browser vendors and standards groups know what you think is missing from the web platform.

If you build for the web, you inevitably run into problems.  Perhaps there's no way to achieve an aspect of your design with CSS, or it may require an incredible amount of experimenting with CSS.  Maybe there's a device feature you want to tap into using JavaScript, or there's a needed Developer Tools feature that can make your job easier.

See [The Web We Want initiative](web-we-want/index.md).
