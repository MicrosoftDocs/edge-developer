## New dedicated setting for CSS Selector Stats in Performance tool

<!-- Subtitle: Use the "Enable CSS selector stats" setting instead of the "Enable advanced rendering instrumentation (slow)" to capture CSS selector statistics for Recalculate Style events-->

In the **Performance** tool, the **Enable advanced rendering instrumentation (slow)** checkbox has been replaced by the **Enable CSS selector stats** checkbox.  This checkbox controls the CSS selector statistics feature.

To record a performance trace with selector stats, select the **Enable CSS selector stats** checkbox, and then record a performance trace.  To view the statistics for a single event, select a `Recalculate Style` event in your recording, and then open the **Selector Stats** tab.

The **Selector Stats** tab has the following changes:

* The **Elapsed** column is sorted from high to low by default, to help you find the most time-consuming CSS selectors.

* The **Fast Reject Count** column has been replaced by the **% of slow-path non-matches** column.

* The unit of time has been changed from microseconds to milliseconds.

## The "Edit and Resend" function has been restored in the Network tool

<!-- Subtitle: Change and resend a network request by right-clicking it and selecting Edit and Resend. -->

In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, right-clicking on a network request you want to change and resend, and then selecting **Edit and Resend** was unresponsive and had no effect.  This issue has been resolved, and **Edit and Resend** works as expected.
