## postMessage events and handlers are distinguished from other events

<!-- Subtitle: Easily investigate performance issues related to posting messages across various threads in applications.  -->

The new experiment **Timeline: Show postMessage dispatch and handling flows** improves the **Performance** tool's **Main** section to help you quickly identify `postMessage` events and handlers, by distinguishing events that are triggered by the `postMessage` method from other events that are displayed in the **Performance** tool.  This experiment helps you investigate performance issues that are related to posting messages across various threads of an application, to view messages between windows, iframes, and dedicated workers.

Without this experiment, events that are triggered by dispatching and handling messages between threads of an application appear as generic scripting function-call events.  With this experiment enabled:
* `postMessage` dispatch events appear as **Schedule postMessage**.
* `postMessage` handler events appear as **On Message**:

!["Schedule postMessage" events and "On Message" events in the Performance tool](./devtools-124-images/post-message-events.png)

This experiment helps you investigate when a `postMessage` call occurred, and how long the message was queued before the `postMessage` handler starts.  The dispatch events are linked to handler events by initiator arrows that appear when you click on either type of event:

To use this feature, in DevTools, select **Customize and control DevTools** (![the Customize and control DevTools icon](./devtools-124-images/customize-and-control-devtools-icon.png)) > **Settings** > **Experiments**, select the checkbox **Timeline: Show postMessage dispatch and handling flows**, click the **Close** (X) button, and then click the **Reload DevTools** button.

## Move a tab left or right in the Activity bar by right-clicking it

<!-- Subtitle: Move the tabs in the Activity bar left or right by using the tab's right-click menu. -->

Before Microsoft Edge 124, you could rearrange the tabs in the **Activity bar** only by dragging them.  This can be difficult for users who are using input devices such as a trackball or head pointer.  Now, you can also move a tab left or right by right-clicking the tab and then selecting **Move left** or **Move right**:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Network tab shows a warning icon when using overrides or throttling

<!-- Subtitle: The warning icon on the Network tab when overrides or throttling is enabled has been restored. -->

Recent releases stopped showing a warning icon in the **Network** tool's tab when using overrides or throttling.  This issue has been fixed.  When you enable local overrides in the **Sources** tool, the **Network** tab now displays a warning icon:

Also, when you turn on throttling in the **Network** tool, the **Network** tab now displays a warning icon:
