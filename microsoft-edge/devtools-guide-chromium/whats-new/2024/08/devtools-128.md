# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 128)

These are the latest features in the Stable release of Microsoft Edge DevTools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Updated labels for CSS selector stats

<!-- Subtitle: Use the "Enable CSS selector stats" checkbox instead of "Enable advanced paint instrumentation (slow)" to capture CSS selector statistics for Recalculate Style events -->

In the **Performance** tool, the duplicate **Selector Stats** label has been removed from the `Recalculate Style` event details.

The **Enable advanced rendering instrumentation (slow)** checkbox has been renamed to **Enable advanced paint instrumentation (slow)**.  Selecting this checkbox now only turns on paint instrumentation, and no longer turns on CSS selector stats as well.  To enable gathering CSS selector stats, in the **Performance** tool, select the **Capture settings** (![the Capture settings icon](./devtools-128-images/capture-settings-icon.png)) button, and then select the **Enable CSS selector stats (slow)** checkbox.

## Fixed whitespace in Activity Bar right-click menus

<!-- Subtitle: Header titles in the top of the Activity Bar's right-click menus have been restored. -->

In recent versions of Microsoft Edge, some context menus in the **Activity Bar** displayed empty whitespace in the header area at the top:

The top of each context menu now shows the title again:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Heap snapshot improvements

<!-- Subtitle: Heap snapshots are generated faster, HTML elements are grouped by tag name, shallow sizes show fewer internal objects, and numeric values are always shown. -->

In the **Memory** tool, there are several improvements for heap snapshots:

* Generating heap snapshots is now faster.

* HTML elements are grouped by tag name, such as `<body>`, `<div>`, or `<img>`.

* Shallow sizes now match JavaScript semantics better, by showing fewer internal objects (unless you select the [Show option to expose internals in heap snapshots](../../../experimental-features/index.md#show-option-to-expose-internals-in-heap-snapshots) experiment checkbox and then, before taking a snapshot, select the **Expose internals (includes additional implementation-specific details)** checkbox).

* The **Include numerical values in capture** checkbox (shown before you take a heap snapshot) has been removed, and heap snapshots now always show numeric values.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## View WebSocket message activities in the Performance tool

<!-- Subtitle: WebSocket activities were added to the Network track in the Performance tool to help correlate JavaScript activity with WebSocket messages. -->

WebSocket activities have been added to the **Network** track in the **Performance** tool, to help correlate JavaScript activity with WebSocket messages.  This can help identify whether latency issues are coming from the client's parsing of a message, or from the server's response.
