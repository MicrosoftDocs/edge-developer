# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 126)

These are the latest features in the Stable release of Microsoft Edge DevTools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Icons for browser extensions are displayed instead of blank squares

<!-- Subtitle: The DevTools extensions that you install will display their icons so they're easily identifiable in the Activity Bar.-->

In the DevTools **Activity Bar** in previous versions of Microsoft Edge, there was a bug where the tab for some browser extensions was missing an icon.  For example, when the React extension was activated, the icon for the extension in the **Activity Bar** was displayed as a grey box.

<!-- todo: add screenshot if can get one from Stable 124 -->

This issue has been fixed; icons for browser extensions are correctly displayed in the **Activity Bar**.

## The DevTools UI in Chinese has changed back to the original font

<!-- Subtitle: When using the DevTools UI in Chinese, the font has been updated back to the previous font that users are familiar with. -->

In recent versions of Microsoft Edge, when the DevTools UI language was set to Chinese, a new default font was displayed.  Per user feedback, the default font has been changed back to the familiar font.
