# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 131)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Visual Studio Code themes are removed

<!-- Subtitle: The Visual Studio Code themes are removed and themes will revert to the default themes: Light+ or Dark+.-->

The Visual Studio Code themes feature is now deprecated.  These themes will revert to the **System preference** theme by default.  The **Light+** and **Dark+** themes continue to be supported.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edge experiment settings can be disabled

<!-- Go to Settings > Experiments to enable or disable any experiments you choose. -->

Previously, the following experiments that were enabled by default couldn't be disabled, even after clearing their checkboxes in the **Settings > Experiments** page and reloading DevTools:
* **Enable webhint**
* **Show issues in Elements**
* **Open source files in Visual Studio Code**

This is now fixed, and you can disable these experiments.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## View CSS selector costs in the Performance tool sidebar

<!-- When the "Enable CSS selector stats (slow)" setting is turned on, view selector stats information in the left sidebar of the Performance tool.-->

The left sidebar in the **Performance** tool displays the costs of CSS selectors in the **Insights** tab:

![CSS selector costs info](./devtools-131-images/selector-stats-info.png)

To view CSS selector costs:

1. In the **Performance** tool, click the **Capture settings** (![Capture settings icon](./devtools-131-images/capture-settings-icon.png)) button, and then select the **Enable CSS selector stats (slow)** checkbox.

1. Take a performance recording.

1. If the **Insights** tab isn't displayed, click the **Show sidebar** (![Show sidebar icon](./devtools-131-images/show-sidebar-icon.png)) button, and then click the **Insights** tab.

1. Click the **CSS Selector costs** button to expand its section.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Fixed edit field to exit after pressing tab after auto-completion

<!-- Press Tab after choosing an autocomplete option to exit the field.-->

Pressing **Tab** after auto-completion now exits the edit field and focuses on the next focus point.  Before, pressing **Tab** would just indent the text.
