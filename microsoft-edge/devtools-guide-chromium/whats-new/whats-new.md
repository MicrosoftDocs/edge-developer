# What's New in Microsoft Edge DevTools

To check out the latest features of Microsoft Edge DevTools and the Microsoft Edge DevTools extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio, read these announcements.

What's New articles correspond to historical releases of Microsoft Edge, and are not updated over time.  References to "new features" and "experiments" might become outdated as new versions of Microsoft Edge are released.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Download the preview channels

To stay up to date and get the latest DevTools features, download an Insiders preview version of Microsoft Edge.  Whether you're on Windows, Linux, or macOS, consider using Canary (or another preview channel) as your default development browser.

The Beta, Dev, and Canary versions of Microsoft Edge run as separate apps, side-by-side with the stable, released version of Microsoft Edge.  See [Microsoft Edge Insider Channels](https://aka.ms/microsoftedge).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Get in touch with the Microsoft Edge DevTools team
