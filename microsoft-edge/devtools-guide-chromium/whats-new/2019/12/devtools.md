### Using the DevTools in other languages

Many developers use other developer tools, like StackOverflow and Visual Studio Code, in their native language, not just in English.  We're excited to announce localization for the DevTools, which you are now able to use in one of 10 languages besides English:

* Chinese (Simplified) - &#20013;&#25991;&#65288;&#31616;&#20307;&#65289;
* Chinese (Traditional) - &#20013;&#25991;&#65288;&#32321;&#39636;&#65289;
* French – fran&#231;ais
* German - deutsch
* Italian - italiano
* Japanese - &#26085;&#26412;&#35486;
* Korean - &#54620;&#44397;&#50612;
* Portuguese - portugu&#234;s
* Russian – &#1088;&#1091;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;
* Spanish - espa&#241;ol

Chromium issue [#987787](https://crbug.com/987787)

### Visual Studio Code extensions

The DevTools team has also released some extensions for [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/vscode) that let you use the power of the DevTools directly from your text editor. Check out the following extensions.

#### Elements for Microsoft Edge

Use the Elements tool from within Visual Studio Code by adding the [Elements for Microsoft Edge ](https://aka.ms/elements4code) Visual Studio Code extension.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/elements-for-edge.msft.png" alt-text="The Elements tool in Visual Studio Code using the Elements for Microsoft Edge extension" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/elements-for-edge.msft.png":::

### Tracking prevention Console messages

Tracking prevention is a unique feature in Microsoft Edge that blocks you from being tracked by a website before you visited it.  The default tracking prevention setting is Balanced mode, which blocks 3rd party trackers and known malicious trackers for an experience that balances privacy and web compatibility.  To give you more insight into the compatibility of your web page when certain trackers are blocked, The Microsoft Edge team added warning messages in the **Console** when a tracker is blocked.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/tracking-prevention.msft.png" alt-text="Messages in the Console when tracking prevention blocks access to storage for a tracker" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/tracking-prevention.msft.png":::

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Announcements from the Chromium project

The following sections announce additional features available in Microsoft Edge 80 that were contributed to the open source Chromium project.

### Support for let and class redeclarations in the Console

The **Console** now supports redeclarations of `let` and `class` statements.  The inability to redeclare was a common annoyance for web developers who use the Console to experiment with new JavaScript code.

> [!WARNING]
> Redeclaring a `let` or `class` statement in a script outside of the Console or within a single Console input still causes a `SyntaxError`.

For example, previously, when re-declaring a local variable with `let`, the Console threw an error:

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/letbefore.msft.png" alt-text="The Console in Microsoft Edge 79 showing that the let redeclaration fails" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/letbefore.msft.png":::
   The **Console** in Microsoft Edge 79 showing that the let re-declaration fails
:::image-end:::

Now, the Console allows the redeclaration:

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/letafter.msft.png" alt-text="The Console in Microsoft Edge 80 showing that the let redeclaration succeeds" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/letafter.msft.png":::
   The **Console** in Microsoft Edge 80 showing that the let re-declaration succeeds
:::image-end:::

Chromium issue [#1004193](https://crbug.com/1004193)

### Improved WebAssembly debugging

DevTools has started to support the DWARF Debugging Standard, which means increased support for stepping over code, setting breakpoints, and resolving stack traces in your source languages within DevTools.

<!-- [TODO: Add this link back] -->
<!--Check out [Improved WebAssembly debugging in Microsoft Edge DevTools](201912Webassembly) for the full story.  -->

<!-- [TODO: Replace this image with screenshot in Edge] -->

### Network panel updates

#### Request Initiator Chains in the Initiator panel

You are now able to view the initiators and dependencies of a network request as a nested list.  This may help you understand why a resource was requested, or what network activity a certain resource (such as a script) caused.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/initiators.msft.png" alt-text="A Request Initiator Chain in the Initiator panel" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/initiators.msft.png":::
   A Request Initiator Chain in the **Initiator** panel
:::image-end:::

After [logging network activity in the Network panel](../../../network/index.md), select a resource and then go to the **Initiator** panel to view the **Request Initiator Chain**:

*   The **inspected resource** is bold.  In the screenshot above, `ai.2.min.js` is the inspected resource.
*   The resources above the inspected resource are the **initiators**.  In the screenshot above, `https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com` is the initiator of `ai.2.min.js`.  In other words, `https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com` caused the network request for `ai.2.min.js`.
*   The resources below the inspected resource are the **dependencies**.  In the screenshot above, `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/v2/track` is a dependency of `ai.2.min.js`.  In other words, `ai.2.min.js` caused the network request for `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/v2/track`.

> [!NOTE]
> Initiator and dependency information can also be accessed by holding `Shift` and then hovering over network resources.  See [View initiators and dependencies](../../../network/reference.md#display-initiators-and-dependencies).

Chromium issue [#842488](https://crbug.com/842488)

#### Highlight the selected network request in the Overview

After you choose a network resource in order to inspect it, the Network panel now puts a blue border around that resource in the **Overview**.  This is able to help you detect if the network request is happening earlier or later than expected.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/overview.msft.png" alt-text="The Overview pane highlighting the inspected resource" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/overview.msft.png":::
   The **Overview** pane highlighting the inspected resource
:::image-end:::

Chromium issue [#988253](https://crbug.com/988253)

#### URL and path columns in the Network panel

Use the new **Path** and **URL** columns in the **Network** tool to display the absolute path or full URL of each network resource.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/columns.msft.png" alt-text="The new Path and URL columns in the Network panel" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/columns.msft.png":::
   The new Path and URL columns in the **Network** tool
:::image-end:::

To display the new columns, hover on the **Waterfall** table header, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Path** or **URL**.

Chromium issue [#993366](https://crbug.com/993366)

#### Updated User-Agent strings

DevTools supports setting a custom User-Agent string through the **Network Conditions** panel.  The User-Agent string affects the `User-Agent` HTTP header attached to network resources, and also the value of `navigator.userAgent`.

The predefined User-Agent strings have been updated to reflect modern browser versions.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/useragent.msft.png" alt-text="The User Agent menu in the Network Conditions panel" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/useragent.msft.png":::
   The User Agent menu in the **Network Conditions** panel
:::image-end:::

To access **Network Conditions**, [open the Command Menu](../../../command-menu/index.md) and run the `Show Network Conditions` command.

> [!NOTE]
> You may also [set User-Agent strings in Device Mode](../../../device-mode/index.md#simulate-a-mobile-viewport).

Chromium issue [#1029031](https://crbug.com/1029031)

### Audits panel updates

#### New configuration UI

The configuration UI has a new, responsive design, and the throttling configuration options have been simplified.  For more information on the throttling UI changes, see [Audits Panel Throttling](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/throttling.md#devtools-audits-panel-throttling).

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/start.msft.png" alt-text="The new configuration UI" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/start.msft.png":::
   The new configuration UI
:::image-end:::

### Coverage tool updates

#### Per-function or per-block coverage modes

The [Coverage](../../../coverage/index.md) tool has a new dropdown menu that lets you specify whether code coverage data should be collected **per function** or **per block**.  **Per block** coverage is more detailed but also far more expensive to collect.  DevTools uses **per function** coverage by default now.

> [!CAUTION]
> You may notice large code coverage differences in HTML files depending on whether you use **per function** or **per block** mode.  When using **per function** mode, inline scripts in HTML files are treated as functions.  If the script runs at all then DevTools marks the entire script as used code.  Only if the script does not run at all does DevTools mark the script as unused code.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2019/12/modes.msft.png" alt-text="The coverage mode dropdown menu" lightbox="../../images/2019/12/modes.msft.png":::
   The coverage mode dropdown menu
:::image-end:::

#### Coverage must now be initiated by a page refresh

Toggling code coverage without a page refresh has been removed because the coverage data was unreliable.  For example, a function may be reported as unused if the runtime was a long time ago and the V8 garbage collector has cleaned it up.

Chromium issue [#1004203](https://crbug.com/1004203)
