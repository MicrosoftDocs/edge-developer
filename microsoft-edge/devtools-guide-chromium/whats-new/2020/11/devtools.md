## Improved webhint and platform tips in the Issues tool

<!-- Title: Improvements to Issues tool and webhint integration  -->
<!-- Subtitle: Categories and third-party filtering make it easier to survey issues in the Issues tool.  Issues surfaced by webhint now have improved code snippets and documentation links to help you fix problems in your website.  -->

An open-source tool, [webhint](https://webhint.io), provides real-time feedback for websites and local webpages.  Starting with [Microsoft Edge version 85](../06/devtools.md#webhint-feedback-in-the-issues-panel), review webhint feedback in the [Issues](../../../issues/index.md) tool.  Issues that appear in the **Issues** tool are now easier to review with the addition of the following categories.

*   [Accessibility](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/accessibility)
*   [Compatibility](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/compatibility)
*   [Performance](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/performance)
*   [Pitfalls](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/pitfalls)
*   [PWA](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/pwa)
*   [Security](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/security)

You are now able to filter out third-party issues using a new checkbox.  The filter functionality helps you hide issues related to code from third-party libraries or other sources.

To help you review issues revealed by [webhint](https://webhint.io), the **Issues** tool now displays the following information.

*   Improved code snippets.
*   Links to other relevant panels.
*   Links to documentation to help you fix problems in your website.

## Composited Layers are now in 3D View

<!-- Title: 3D View is now integrated with Composited Layers  -->
<!-- Subtitle: Composited Layers are now in 3D View.  -->

:::image type="icon" source="../../media/2020/06/experimental-tag-14px.msft.png":::

You may now visualize **Layers** content alongside z-index values and the Document Object Model (DOM).  This feature helps you debug without switching between the [3D view](../../../3d-view/index.md) and **Layers** tools as often.  For a comprehensive visual debugging experience, the [3D View and Composited Layers are now combined](../../../3d-view/index.md).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## CSS variable definitions in Styles pane

<!-- Title: Jump to CSS variable definitions  -->
<!-- Subtitle: Choose any CSS variable to navigate directly to the definition in the Styles tool. -->

In the **Styles** pane, [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) now link directly to each definition.  Choose the variable to easily view or change the CSS variable definition.  In the example, DevTools displays the CSS attributes for the `body` element.  To display the variable definition for the `--theme-body-background` CSS variable, complete the following actions.

1.  In the **Styles** pane, choose `var(--theme-body-background)`.
1.  The **Styles** pane now displays the definition of the `--theme-body-background` CSS variable.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Service worker debugging improvements

<!-- Title:  Service worker debugging improvements in the Network, Application, and Sources tools  -->
<!-- Subtitle:  Making service workers easier to debug for progressive web applications and more.  -->

The following new features in the [Network](#network-tool), [Application](#application-tool), and [Sources](#sources-tool) tools help you build your [PWA](../../../../progressive-web-apps-chromium/index.md).  Use the following features when you have difficulty debugging your service worker.

Request routing displays the `startup` and `fetch` events based on the network requests that run through service workers.  The timelines are accessed from either the **Application** or **Network** tool.  The timelines help when you are having trouble with service workers and want to display if something is wrong with the `startup` or `fetch` event.

### Application tool

<!-- Title: Open Network tool from the Service Workers pane  -->
<!-- Subtitle: Display additional context when debugging a service worker.  -->

View all service worker request routing information with the new **Network requests** link.  To display additional context when debugging the service worker, complete the following actions.

1.  Navigate to **Application** > **Service Workers**.
1.  Choose **Network requests**.

    :::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/11/service-worker-application-network-requests.msft.png" alt-text="Open Network tool from the Service Workers pane" lightbox="../../media/2020/11/service-worker-application-network-requests.msft.png":::
       Open **Network** tool from the **Service Workers** pane
    :::image-end:::

1.  The **Network** tool opens in the **drawer** and displays all service worker-related network requests.  The network requests are filtered using `is:service-worker-intercepted`.

    :::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/11/service-worker-application-network-drawer.msft.png" alt-text="Network tool in drawer" lightbox="../../media/2020/11/service-worker-application-network-drawer.msft.png":::
       **Network** tool in **drawer**
    :::image-end:::

1. To return the **Network** tool to the top panel, close the **drawer**.

       Close the **drawer** to return **Network** tool
    :::image-end:::

### Network tool

Debug network requests that run through service workers.  You may also open network requests from the **Application** tool.  For each request, DevTools display the following information in the [Timing](../../../network/reference.md#display-the-timing-breakdown-of-a-request) pane.

*   The start of a request and duration of the bootstrap.
*   Changes to service worker registration.
*   The runtime of a `fetch` event handler.
*   The runtime of all `fetch` events for loading a client.

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/11/network-timing-service-worker.msft.png" alt-text="Timing pane" lightbox="../../media/2020/11/network-timing-service-worker.msft.png":::
   **Timing** pane
:::image-end:::

### Sources tool

In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, the level of depth in the call stack was limited to the JavaScript code in your service worker.  In Microsoft Edge 88, the call stack now displays the initiator of requests that run through your service worker.

To locate the initiator of the request, use the call stack of your JavaScript code in the service worker.  The call stack in the following figures starts with the JavaScript code in your service worker and displays a reference to the original webpage request as `(index):157`.  In the second figure, the reference is chosen and opened the initiator that made the request.  The initiator in the second figure is the webpage.

The `service-worker.js` file and call stack highlighting the request originator:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Copy property value of a network request

<!-- Title: Copy response JSON in Network tool using the contextual menu  -->
<!-- Subtitle:  The Network tool now has a more consistent UX.  Easily copy the JSON response using the contextual menu.  -->

In the **Network** tool, copy the property value of a network request using the new **Copy value** option.  The property value is copied as a decoded JSON value.  In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, you had to copy a value using one of the following actions.

*   Highlight the entire text and copy it.
*   Store the value as global variable, as applicable, and copy it from the DevTools [Console](../../../console/index.md).

To copy the property value to your clipboard, see [Copy formatted response JSON to the clipboard](../../../network/reference.md#copy-formatted-response-json-to-the-clipboard).  To review the history of this feature in the Chromium open-source project, see Issue [1132084](https://crbug.com/1132084).

## Customize multi-press keyboard shortcuts

<!-- Title: Customize multi-press keyboard shortcuts  -->
<!-- Subtitle: Create custom multi-press keyboard shortcuts in the shortcut editor.  -->

:::image type="icon" source="../../media/2020/06/experimental-tag-14px.msft.png":::

[Since Microsoft Edge version 87](../10/devtools.md#customize-keyboard-shortcuts-in-settings), you may customize keyboard shortcuts for any action in DevTools.  In Microsoft Edge version 88, you may now create multi-press keyboard shortcuts.  To set a shortcut for an action in the DevTools, navigate to [Settings](../../../customize/index.md#settings) > **Experiments**  and choose the checkbox next to **Enable keyboard shortcut editor**.  For more information about customizing and editing shortcuts, navigate to [Edit keyboard shortcuts for any action in the DevTools](../../../customize/shortcuts.md#edit-the-keyboard-shortcut-for-a-devtools-action).

For example, the red highlight displays a multi-press keyboard shortcut customized for the **Start recording events** action.  To review real-time updates on this feature in the Chromium open-source project, navigate to [Issue #174309](https://crbug.com/174309).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## DevTools now match browser language

In Microsoft Edge version 87, if you turned on the **Match browser language** setting in [DevTools Settings](../../../customize/index.md#settings), DevTools did not match the browser language.  In Microsoft Edge version 88, DevTools now matches the browser language if you turn on the **Match browser language** setting.  For more information about the **Match browser language** DevTools Setting, navigate to [Change DevTools language settings](../../../customize/localization.md).

## Announcements from the Chromium project

[!INCLUDE [Chromium What's New note](../../includes/chromium-whats-new-note.md)]

### New CSS angle visualization tools

DevTools now have better support for CSS angle debugging.  When an HTML element on your page has CSS angle applied to it, a clock icon is displayed next to the angle in the **Styles** tool.  To toggle the clock overlay, click the clock icon.  To change the angle, click anywhere in the clock or drag the needle.  To change the angle value, you can also use mouse and keyboard shortcuts.  To learn more, see [Change angle value with the Angle Clock](../../../css/reference.md#change-angle-value-with-the-angle-clock).  To view real-time updates on this feature in the Chromium open-source project, see Issues [1126178](https://crbug.com/1126178) and [1138633](https://crbug.com/1138633).

The following CSS angle is used for the example:

```css
background: linear-gradient(100deg, lightblue, pink);
```

:::image-end:::

### Frame details view updates

#### Cross-origin isolation information in the Frame details view

The cross-origin isolated status is now displayed under the **Security & Isolation** section.  The new **API availability** section displays the availability of `SharedArrayBuffer`s (SAB) and whether the buffers may be shared using `postMessage()`.  A deprecation warning displays if the SAB and `postMessage()` is currently available, but the context is not cross-origin isolated.  For more information about cross-origin isolation and why it is required for features like `SharedArrayBuffers`, navigate to [WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.crossOriginIsolated](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/crossOriginIsolated).  To review real-time updates of this feature in the Chromium open-source project, navigate to Issue [1139899](https://crbug.com/1139899).

   Cross-origin information
:::image-end:::

#### New Web Workers information in the Frame details view

DevTools now organizes web workers under the relevant parent frame.  For example, if the `someName` frame creates `worker.js`, then `worker.js` appears under `someName` in the **Frames** list.  To view the details of the web worker, complete the following actions.

1.  Open **Application** tool.
1.  Expand a frame that contains web workers.
1.  Expand the **Workers** tree.
1.  Choose a worker.

To review real-time updates on this feature in the Chromium open-source project, navigate to Issues [1122507](https://crbug.com/1122507) and [1051466](https://crbug.com/1051466).

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/11/application-frames-service-workers.msft.png" alt-text="Web workers information" lightbox="../../media/2020/11/application-frames-service-workers.msft.png":::
   Web workers information
:::image-end:::

#### Display opener frame details for opened windows

DevTools now organizes opened [Windows](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window#Constructors) under the relevant parent [frame](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/frames).  For example, if the `top` frame opens a `Window` to `https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium`, then the `Window` appears under `top` in the **Frames** list.

To reveal the frame responsible for opening another Window in the **Elements** tool, complete the following actions.

1.  Open the **Frames** tree.
1.  Expand **Opened Windows** and choose the `Window` for the parent frame you want to know.
1.  Choose the **Opener Frame** link.

The details are displayed about which frame caused the opening of another `Window`.  To reveal the opener in the **Elements** tool, complete the following actions.

1.  Open the **Frames** tree.
1.  Choose an opened window to open the `Window` details.
1.  Choose the **Opener Frame** link.

To review the history of this feature in the Chromium open-source project, navigate to Issue [1107766](https://crbug.com/1107766).

   Copy stacktrace
:::image-end:::

### Preview Wasm variable value on mouseover

Use this feature to review the value of a WebAssembly (Wasm) variable when your code is paused.  To display the current value of a variable, hover on a variable.  To review real-time updates on this feature in the Chromium open-source project, navigate to Issues [1058836](https://crbug.com/1058836) and [1071432](https://crbug.com/1071432).

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/11/wasm-mouseover.msft.png" alt-text="Preview Wasm variable on mouseover" lightbox="../../media/2020/11/wasm-mouseover.msft.png":::
   Preview Wasm variable on mouseover
:::image-end:::

### Consistent units of measurement for sizes of files and memory

DevTools now consistently use `kB` for displaying sizes of files and memory.  Previously DevTools mixed `kB` and `KiB`.

*   `kB` or kilobyte (10^3 or 1000 bytes)
*   `KiB` or kibibyte (2^10 or 1024 bytes)

For example, the **Network** tool previously used `kB` in the labels, but used `KiB` in calculations.  Your feedback showed that this inconsistency caused confusion.  To review the history of this feature in the Chromium open-source project, navigate to Issue [1035309](https://crbug.com/1035309).
