# What's New In DevTools (Microsoft Edge 81)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Announcements from the Microsoft Edge DevTools team

The following sections are a list of announcements you may have missed from the Microsoft Edge DevTools team.  Check out the announcements to try new features in the DevTools, Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions, and more.  To stay up to date on all the latest and greatest features in your developer tools, download the [Microsoft Edge preview channels](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/download) and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EdgeDevTools).

### Accessibility improvements to the DevTools

The DevTools team has contributed 170 changes to Chromium to address high-impact color contrast, keyboard, and screen reader issues in the DevTools.  Every developer building the web should be able to use the DevTools.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/a11y-performance-tool.msft.gif" alt-text="The Performance tool in the DevTools with the keyboard navigation and screen reader improvements" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/a11y-performance-tool.msft.gif":::

Want to learn how to make your web page accessible to all of your users?  Download the [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) and [webhint](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/extensions/extension-browser) extensions for Microsoft Edge to get started.

If you use screen readers or the keyboard to navigate around the DevTools, send us your feedback by [tweeting](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@EdgeDevTools) at us or clicking the **Send Feedback** icon!

Chromium issue [#963183](https://crbug.com/963183)

### Using the DevTools in other languages

Many developers use other developer tools, like StackOverflow and Visual Studio Code, in their native language, not just in English.  We're excited to announce localization for the DevTools, which you are now able to use in one of 10 languages besides English:

* Chinese (Simplified) - &#20013;&#25991;&#65288;&#31616;&#20307;&#65289;
* Chinese (Traditional) - &#20013;&#25991;&#65288;&#32321;&#39636;&#65289;
* French – fran&#231;ais
* German - deutsch
* Italian - italiano
* Japanese - &#26085;&#26412;&#35486;
* Korean - &#54620;&#44397;&#50612;
* Portuguese - portugu&#234;s
* Russian – &#1088;&#1091;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;
* Spanish - espa&#241;ol

<!--
|  |  |
|:--- |:--- |
| Chinese (Simplified) - 中文(简体)（简体）| Chinese (Traditional) - 中文(繁體)（繁體）|
| French – français | German - deutsch |
| Italian - italiano | Portuguese - português |
| Korean - 한국어 | Japanese - 日本語 |
| Russian – русский | Spanish - español |
-->

The DevTools automatically match the language you use for Microsoft Edge in `edge://settings/languages`.

If you want Microsoft Edge to be in one language and your DevTools to remain in English, select `F1` in the DevTools to open [Settings](../../../customize/index.md#settings) and disable **Match browser language**.

:::image-end:::

**Console** messages are not localized.  Only the strings used in the DevTools UI are displayed in the language you use for Microsoft Edge.

If you want to use the DevTools in a different language than the ones that are available, [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@EdgeDevTools) at us or choose the **Send Feedback** icon.

### Tracking prevention Console messages

Tracking prevention is a unique feature in Microsoft Edge that protects you from being tracked by websites you have not visited before.  The default tracking prevention setting is Balanced mode, which blocks 3rd party trackers and known malicious trackers for an experience that balances privacy and web compatibility.  To give you more insight into the compatibility of your web page when certain trackers are blocked, warning messages were added in the **Console** when a tracker is blocked.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/tracking-prevention.msft.png" alt-text="Messages in the Console when tracking prevention blocks access to storage for a tracker" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/tracking-prevention.msft.png":::

## Announcements from the Chromium project

The following sections announce additional features available in Microsoft Edge 81 that were contributed to the open source Chromium project.

### Moto G4 support in Device Mode

After [enabling the Device Toolbar](../../../device-mode/index.md#simulate-a-mobile-viewport), simulate the dimensions of a Moto G4 viewport from the **Device** list.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/motog4.msft.png" alt-text="Simulating a Moto G4 viewport" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/motog4.msft.png":::
   Simulating a Moto G4 viewport
:::image-end:::

Choose [Show Device Frame](../../../device-mode/index.md#show-device-frame) to show the Moto G4 hardware around the viewport.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/motog4frame.msft.png" alt-text="Showing the Moto G4 hardware" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/motog4frame.msft.png":::
   Showing the Moto G4 hardware
:::image-end:::

Related features:

*   Open the [Command Menu](../../../command-menu/index.md) and run the `Capture screenshot` command to take a screenshot of the viewport that includes the Moto G4 hardware (after enabling **Show Device Frame**).
*   [Throttle the network and CPU](../../../device-mode/index.md#throttle-the-network-and-cpu) to more accurately simulate a mobile user's web browsing conditions.

Chromium issue [#924693](https://crbug.com/924693)

### Cookie-related updates

#### Blocked cookies in the Cookies pane

The Cookies pane in the Application panel now displays blocked cookies with a yellow background.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/blockedcookies.msft.png" alt-text="Blocked cookies in the Cookies pane of the Application panel" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/blockedcookies.msft.png":::
   Blocked cookies in the Cookies pane of the Application panel
:::image-end:::

Chromium issue [#1030258](https://crbug.com/1030258)  <!-- inaccessible  -->

#### Cookie priority in the Cookie pane

The Cookies tables in the **Network** and **Application** tools now include a **Priority** column.

> [!CAUTION]
> Chromium-based browsers, like Microsoft Edge, are the only browsers that support cookie priority.

Chromium issue [#1026879](https://crbug.com/1026879)

#### Edit all cookie values

All cells in the Cookie tables are editable now, except cells in the **Size** column because that column represents the network size of the cookie, in bytes.  For an explanation of each column, navigate to [Fields](../../../storage/cookies.md#fields).

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/editcookie.msft.png" alt-text="Editing a cookie value" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/editcookie.msft.png":::
   Editing a cookie value
:::image-end:::

#### Copy as Node.js fetch to include cookie data

To get a `fetch` expression that includes cookie data, hover on a network request, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Copy** > **Copy as Node.js fetch**.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/fetchcookies.msft.png" alt-text="Copy as Node.js fetch" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/fetchcookies.msft.png":::
   Copy as Node.js fetch
:::image-end:::

Chromium issue [#1029826](https://crbug.com/1029826)

### More accurate web app manifest icons

Previously, the Manifest pane in the Application panel sent its own requests in order to display web app manifest icons.  DevTools now shows the exact same manifest icon that Microsoft Edge uses.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/manifesticons.msft.png" alt-text="Icons in the Manifest pane" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/manifesticons.msft.png":::
   Icons in the Manifest pane
:::image-end:::

Chromium issue [#985402](https://crbug.com/985402)

### Hover on CSS content properties to display unescaped values

Hover on the value of a `content` property to display the unescaped version of the value.

For example, in this [demo](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/css-dbg-stories/css-escapes.html) when you inspect the `p::after` pseudo-element an escaped string is displayed in the **Styles** pane:

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/escapedstring.msft.png" alt-text="The escaped string" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/escapedstring.msft.png":::
   The escaped string
:::image-end:::

When you hover on the `content` value, the unescaped value is displayed.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/unescapedstring.msft.png" alt-text="The unescaped value" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/unescapedstring.msft.png":::
   The unescaped value
:::image-end:::

### More detailed source map errors in the Console

The Console now provides more detail on why a source map failed to load or parse.  Previously it just provided an error without explaining what went wrong.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/sourcemap.msft.png" alt-text="A source map loading error in the Console" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/sourcemap.msft.png":::
   A source map loading error in the Console
:::image-end:::

### Setting for disabling scrolling past the end of a file

Open [Settings](../../../customize/index.md#settings) and then disable **Preferences** > **Sources** > **Allow scrolling past end of file** to disable the default UI behavior that allows you to scroll well past the end of a file in the **Sources** panel.

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/settings.msft.png" alt-text="Disabling Allow scrolling past end of file" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/settings.msft.png":::
   Disabling **Allow scrolling past end of file** in Settings
:::image-end:::

:::image type="complex" source="../../images/2020/01/scrollingsources.msft.png" alt-text="Scrolling past the end of a file is now disabled in the Sources panel" lightbox="../../images/2020/01/scrollingsources.msft.png":::
   Scrolling past the end of a file is now disabled in the Sources panel
:::image-end:::
