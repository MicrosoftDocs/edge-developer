### Edit and Replay requests with the Network Console  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experimental-tag-14px.msft.png" alt-text="Experimental feature":::
   Experimental feature  
:::image-end:::  

You are now able to use **Edit and Replay** on requests in the [Network Log][DevtoolsNetworkIndexLogActivity] using the **Network Console**.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experiments-network-console-edit-and-replay.msft.png" alt-text="Edit and Replay a request in the NetworkLog with the Network Console" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/experiments-network-console-edit-and-replay.msft.png":::
   Edit and Replay a request in the [NetworkLog][DevtoolsNetworkIndexLogActivity] with the **Network Console**  
:::image-end:::  

A new panel, the **Network Console** opens in the [DevTools Drawer][DevtoolsCustomizeIndexDrawer] and automatically populates with information for the HTTP request.  To see the response returned from the server, edit the request \(if needed\) and select **Send**.  

You may also use the **Network Console** to create and send HTTP requests directly from the DevTools.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experiments-network-console.msft.png" alt-text="The Network Console panel" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/experiments-network-console.msft.png":::

Chromium issue [#1093687][CR1093687]  

### Service worker respondWith events in the Timing tab  

The **Timing** tab of the **Network** panel now includes `respondWith` service worker events.  The `respondWith` service worker event shows the duration from the time immediately before the service worker `fetch` event handler starts running to the time when the `respondWith` promise of the `fetch` handler is settled.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/timing-tab.msft.png" alt-text="The respondWith service worker event in the Timing tab of the Network panel" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/timing-tab.msft.png":::

Chromium issue [#1066579][CR1066579]  

### webhint feedback in the Issues panel  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experimental-tag-14px.msft.png" alt-text="Experimental feature":::
   Experimental feature  
:::image-end:::  

[webhint][WebhintMain] is an open-source tool that provides real-time feedback on the accessibility, cross-browser compatibility, security, performance, PWAs, and other common web development issues of websites.  You are now able to see webhint feedback in the [Issues][DevtoolsIssues] panel.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experiments-webhint.msft.png" alt-text="webhint feedback in the Issues panel" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/experiments-webhint.msft.png":::

> 
> Open the [Issues][DevtoolsIssues] panel to see feedback from webhint.  

Chromium issue [#1070378][CR1070378]  

### Move tools between panels  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experimental-tag-14px.msft.png" alt-text="Experimental feature":::
   Experimental feature  
:::image-end:::  

Normally, tools such as **Elements** and **Network** may only be opened in the main \(top\) panel of DevTools.  Similarly, tools such as **3D View** and **Issues** may only be opened in the drawer \(bottom\) panel of DevTools.  You are now able to customize your DevTools layout by moving tools between the top and bottom panels.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/experiments-move-panels.msft.png" alt-text="Moving tabs between panels" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/experiments-move-panels.msft.png":::
   Moving tabs between panels  
:::image-end:::  

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the experiment, see [Turn on experimental features][DevtoolsExperimentalFeaturesTurnOn] and select the checkbox next to **Enable support to move tabs between panels**.  

Chromium issue [#897944][CR897944]  

### Improved Initiator tooltip in the Network panel  

In Microsoft Edge 83 and 84, tooltips for the Initiator column, which shows the cause of the resource request, in the [Network Log][DevtoolsNetworkIndexLogActivity] displayed with a horizontal scrollbar.  You were only able to see the call stack that initiated the request by scrolling horizontally in the tooltip.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/initiator-tooltip-84.msft.png" alt-text="The Initiator tooltip in Microsoft Edge 84" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/initiator-tooltip-84.msft.png":::
   The Initiator tooltip in Microsoft Edge 84  
:::image-end:::  

Starting with Microsoft Edge 85, you are now able to see the Initiator call stack in the tooltip without scrolling horizontally.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/initiator-tooltip-85.msft.png" alt-text="The Initiator tooltip in Microsoft Edge 85" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/initiator-tooltip-85.msft.png":::

Chromium issue [#1069404][CR1069404]  

## Announcements from the Chromium project  

The following sections announce additional features available in Microsoft Edge 85 that were contributed to the open source Chromium project.  

### Style editing for CSS-in-JS frameworks  

The **Styles** pane now has better support for editing styles that were created with the [CSS Object Model (CSSOM)][CsswgDraftsCssom] APIs.  Many CSS-in-JS frameworks and libraries use the CSSOM APIs under the hood to construct styles.  

You are now able to edit styles added in JavaScript using [Constructable Stylesheets][WicgConstructStylesheet].  Constructable Stylesheets are a new way to create and distribute reusable styles when using [Shadow DOM][MdnShadowDom].  

For example, the `h1` styles added with `CSSStyleSheet` \(CSSOM APIs\) were not editable previously.  The styles are editable now in the **Styles** pane.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/css-in-js.msft.png" alt-text="Changing the background property of the h1 styles added with CSSStyleSheet from pink to lightblue" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/css-in-js.msft.png":::
   Changing the `background` property of the `h1` styles added with `CSSStyleSheet` from `pink` to `lightblue`.
:::image-end:::  

Give this feature a try with a [sample that uses CSS-in-JS][CodepenZoherghadyaliAbdgrpz].

Chromium issue [#946975][CR946975]  

### Lighthouse 6 in the Lighthouse panel  

The **Lighthouse** panel is now running Lighthouse 6.  For a full list of all changes, see [v6.0.0 release notes][GithubGoogleChromeLighthouse600].  

Lighthouse 6.0 introduces three new metrics to the report:  Largest Contentful Paint \(LCP\), Cumulative Layout Shift \(CLS\), and Total Blocking Time \(TBT\).  

The performance score formula has also been reweighted to better reflect the loading experience of the user.  

Chromium issue [#772558][CR772558]  

#### First Meaningful Paint deprecation  

First Meaningful Paint \(FMP\) is deprecated in Lighthouse 6.0.  FMP has also been removed from the **Performance** panel.  **Largest Contentful Paint** is the recommended replacement for FMP.  <!--See [First Meaningful Paint][WebDevFirstMeaningfulPaint] for an explanation of why it was deprecated.  -->  

<!--todo: add Largest Contentful Paint when section available  -->  
<!--todo: add First Meaningful Paint link and note when available  -->  

Chromium issue [#1096008][CR1096008]  

### Support for new JavaScript features  

DevTools now has better support for some of the latest JavaScript language features.  

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      [Optional chaining][V8DevOptionalChaining] syntax autocompletion  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Property auto-completion in the **Console** now supports optional chaining syntax, for example,  `name?.` now works in addition to `name.` and `name[`.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      Syntax highlighting for [private fields][V8DevClassFieldsPrivate]  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      private class fields are now properly syntax-highlighted and pretty-printed in the **Sources** panel.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      Syntax highlighting for [Nullish coalescing operator][V8DevNullishCoalescing]
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      DevTools now properly pretty-prints the nullish coalescing operator in the **Sources** panel.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::  

Chromium issues [#1073903][CR1073903], [#1083214][CR1083214], [#1083797][CR1083797]  

### New app shortcut warnings in the Manifest pane  

**App shortcuts** help users quickly start common or recommended tasks within a web app.  

<!--todo: add App shortcuts when section is live  -->  

The **Manifest** pane now shows warnings for the following conditions.  

* The app shortcut icons are smaller than 96x96 pixels  
* The app shortcut icons and manifest icons are not square \(since the icons are ignored\)  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/app-shortcut-warnings.msft.png" alt-text="App shortcut warnings" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/app-shortcut-warnings.msft.png":::
   App shortcut warnings  
:::image-end:::  

Chromium issue [#955497][CR955497]  

### Consistent display of the Computed pane  

The **Computed** pane in the **Elements** panel now displays consistently as a pane across all viewport sizes.  Previously the **Computed** pane merged inside the **Styles** pane when the width of the DevTools viewport was narrow.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/computed-pane.msft.png" alt-text="The Computed pane consistently displays as a separate pane even when the DevTools are narrow" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/computed-pane.msft.png":::
   The **Computed** pane consistently displays as a separate pane even when the DevTools are narrow.
:::image-end:::  

Chromium issue [#1073899][CR1073899]  

### Bytecode offsets for WebAssembly files  

DevTools now uses bytecode offsets for displaying line numbers of Wasm disassembly.  
The line numbers make it clearer that you are looking at binary data, and is more consistent with how the Wasm runtime references locations.  

Chromium issue [#1071432][CR1071432]  

### Line-wise copy and cut in Sources Panel  

When performing copy or cut with no selection in the [Sources panel editor][DevtoolsSourcesEditCssJavascript], DevTools copies or cuts the current line of content.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/line-wise-cut.msft.png" alt-text="With the cursor at the end of Line 5, copying the whole line from pen.js in the DevTools and pasting in Visual Studio Code" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/line-wise-cut.msft.png":::
   With the cursor at the end of Line 5, copying the whole line from **pen.js** in the DevTools and pasting in [Visual Studio Code][VSCode].
:::image-end:::  

Chromium issue [#800028][CR800028]

### Console Settings updates  

#### Ungroup same console messages  

The **Group similar** toggle in Console Settings now applies to duplicate messages.  Previously it just applied to similar messages.  

For example, previously, DevTools did not ungroup the `hello` messages even though **Group similar** is unchecked.  Now, the `hello` messages are ungrouped.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/ungroup-similar.msft.png" alt-text="When Group similar is unchecked, the hello messages are ungrouped" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/ungroup-similar.msft.png":::
   When **Group similar** is unchecked, the `hello` messages are ungrouped
:::image-end:::  

Give this feature a try with a [sample that sends duplicate messages to the Console][CodepenZoherghadyaliZyrjgdJ].  

Chromium issue [#1082963][CR1082963]  

### Persisting Selected context only settings  

The **Selected context only** settings in Console Settings is now persisted.  Previously the settings were reset every time you closed and reopened DevTools.  The change makes the setting behavior consistent with other Console Settings options.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/selected-context.msft.png" alt-text="Selected context only setting" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/selected-context.msft.png":::
   **Selected context only** setting  
:::image-end:::  

Chromium issue [#1055875][CR1055875]  

### Performance panel updates  

#### JavaScript compilation cache information in Performance panel  

[JavaScript compilation cache information][V8DevCodeCaching] is now always displayed in the Summary tab of the Performance panel.  Previously, DevTools did not show anything related to code caching if code caching did not happen.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/js-compilation-cache.msft.png" alt-text="JavaScript compilation cache information" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/js-compilation-cache.msft.png":::
   JavaScript compilation cache information  
:::image-end:::  

Chromium issue [#912581][CR912581]  

#### Navigation timing alignment in the Performance panel  

The **Performance** panel used to show times in the rulers based on when the recording started.  The timing has now changed for recordings where the user navigates, where DevTools now shows ruler times relative to the navigation instead.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/nav-timing.msft.png" alt-text="Align navigation timing in Performance panel" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/nav-timing.msft.png":::
   Align navigation timing in **Performance** panel  
:::image-end:::  

The times for `DOMContentLoaded`, First Paint, First Contentful Paint, and Largest Contentful Paint events are updated to be relative to the start of the navigation, which means the timing matches the timings reported by `PerformanceObserver`.  

Chromium issue [#974550][CR974550]  

### New icons for breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and logpoints  

The **Sources** panel has new designs for breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and logpoints.  Breakpoints are represented by a red circle, just like [Visual Studio Code][VSCode] and [Visual Studio][VS].  Icons are added to differentiate conditional breakpoints and logpoints.  

:::image type="complex" source="../../media/2020/06/breakpoints.msft.png" alt-text="Breakpoints" lightbox="../../media/2020/06/breakpoints.msft.png":::
   Breakpoints  
:::image-end:::  

Chromium issue [#1041830][CR1041830]
