# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 116)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## New "Move Activity Bar" button directly on the Activity Bar

In Focus Mode, you now can quickly move the **Activity Bar** with a single mouse-click.  In the upper left of DevTools, next to the **Inspect** button and **Device Emulation** button, there's now a **Move Activity Bar to left** or **Move Activity Bar to top** button:

![The 'Move Activity Bar to top' button directly on the Activity Bar](./devtools-116-images/move-activity-bar-to-top.png)

For example, by default, the **Activity Bar** is horizontal, but you can change it to vertical by simply clicking the new **Move Activity Bar to left** button in the **Activity Bar**, instead of having to go into the DevTools **Settings** (...) menu.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## React Developer Tools extension retains state of tools

Prior to Microsoft Edge 116, if you were in Focus Mode while using the React Developer Tools extension, the state of a tool in DevTools wasn't maintained when you switched to another tool and then switched back.  This issue has been fixed.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## "Containment Diff" view in Memory tool when multiple heap snapshots

In the **Memory** tool, when there's more than one heap snapshot, a **Containment Diff** view is now available in the **Perspective** dropdown menu in the upper left of the **Memory** tool:

![The Containment Diff view in the Memory tool](./devtools-116-images/containment-diff.png)

The **Containment Diff** view shows only the new objects, deleted objects, or objects in the retaining chain that will eventually lead to either a new or deleted node.  The dot symbol â€¢ means that it's a node in the retaining chain.  Expanding the view displays the node that's new or deleted.

For example: 

1. Open the example webpage [Example 9: DOM leaks bigger than expected](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-memory-heap-snapshot/example-09.html) in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the webpage and then select **Inspect**.  DevTools opens.

1. In the **Activity Bar**, select the **Memory** tool.

1. Click the **Take heap snapshot** button, in the upper left.  **Snapshot 1** is listed in the **Profiles** section.

1. In the rendered example webpage, click the **Create tree** button.

1. In the **Memory** tool, click the **Take heap snapshot** button again.  **Snapshot 2** is added in the **Profiles** section.

1. In the **Perspective** dropdown menu, instead of **Summary**, select **Containment Diff**.

1. In the **Object** column, expand an entry.
