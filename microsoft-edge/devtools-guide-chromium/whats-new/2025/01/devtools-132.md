# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 132)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## CSS selector costs now include links in the Insights sidebar

<!-- Subtitle: Selectors have clickable links to their stylesheet in the Insights sidebar. -->

The left sidebar in the **Performance** tool displays the costs of CSS selectors in the **Insights** tab when the **Enable CSS selector stats (slow)** checkbox is enabled.  Now, the selectors have links to the stylesheets that contain them.

Some selectors might have more than one link when they are defined in multiple locations in a stylesheet or defined in multiple stylesheets.  For example, two links will be shown as **[1], [2]**. Selectors from user agent stylesheets or dynamically created stylesheets won't have links.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Move a tab left or right in the Quick View toolbar by right-clicking it

<!-- Subtitle: Move the tabs in the Quick View toolbar left or right by using the tab's right-click menu. -->

Previously, you could rearrange the tabs in **Quick View** only by dragging them.  This can be difficult for users who are using input devices such as a trackball or head pointer.  Now, you can also move a tab left or right by right-clicking the tab and then selecting **Move left** or **Move right**:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Heap snapshot objects are categorized by constructor names and source locations in the Memory tool

<!-- JS objects are grouped by their names and sources in the Memory tool.-->

Before, when JavaScript objects in the heap snapshot Summary view were grouped by the names of their constructors, it was possible for distinct constructors to have the same name, meaning unrelated objects could end up in the same group.

Now, JS objects are grouped together based on their constructor names and source locations.
