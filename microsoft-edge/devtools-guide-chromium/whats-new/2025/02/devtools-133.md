# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 133)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Move a tab left or right within the Elements or Sources tool

<!-- Subtitle: Move a tab left or right within a tab group in the Elements or Sources tool by right-clicking the tab. -->

Previously, within the **Elements** tool and **Sources** tool, you could rearrange the tabs within a tab group only by dragging them.  Dragging a tab can be difficult when using a trackball, head pointer, or keyboard.  Now, you can also move a tab by right-clicking the tab (or pressing the **Context menu** key) and then selecting **Move left** or **Move right**.

Right-clicking a tab within the **Elements** tool:

Right-clicking a tab within the **Sources** tool:

## Screen reader support improvements

<!-- Subtitle: Screen reader support improvements in Developer resources, Elements, and CSS overview.-->

Support for screen readers has been improved for various tools.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Developer resources tool

In the **Developer resources** tool, after you search by using the **Filter by URL and error** text box, screen readers announce the results information.  If no results are available, screen readers announce "No resource matches":

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Elements tool

In the **Elements** tool, screen readers announce the expanded or collapsed state of the **More tabs** button and tab group, shown here in the expanded state:

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS overview tool

In the **CSS overview** tool, when navigating to a tab, screen readers announce the tab label.  After entering that tab and then navigating to an **occurrences** button, screen readers announce the button's label, such as "Two occurrences":
