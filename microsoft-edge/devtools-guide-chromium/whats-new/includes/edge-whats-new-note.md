To check out the latest features of Microsoft Edge DevTools and the Microsoft Edge DevTools extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio, read these announcements.

To stay up to date and get the latest DevTools features, download an Insiders preview version of Microsoft Edge.  Whether you're on Windows, Linux, or macOS, consider using Canary (or another preview channel) as your default development browser.  The Beta, Dev, and Canary versions of Microsoft Edge run as separate apps, side-by-side with the stable, released version of Microsoft Edge.  See [Microsoft Edge Insider Channels](https://aka.ms/microsoftedge).

For the latest announcements, [follow the Microsoft Edge team on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSEdgeDev). To report a problem with DevTools or ask for a new feature, file an issue in the [MicrosoftEdge/DevTools](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevTools) repo.
