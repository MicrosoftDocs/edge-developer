# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 105)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Focus Mode: Improved location controls for DevTools, Activity Bar, and Quick View

<!-- Title: Focus Mode: Improved location controls for DevTools, Activity Bar, and Quick View -->
<!-- Subtitle: Focus Mode: Improved location controls for DevTools, Activity Bar, and Quick View. -->

For users of Focus Mode, several improvements have been made to existing location controls for DevTools, including a new control for changing the orientation of Quick View.

The Settings menu provides options for changing DevTools between docked locations and a separate window. This menu also contains settings for how the Activity Bar is displayed. Starting in Edge 105, these options can be navigated and changed more quickly. The previous submenus have been replaced with toggle buttons. Additionally, improved contrast means the option you have selected is more easily visible at a glance.

<!-- 
Screenshot 1, "before" in Edge 105: Ensure Focus Mode is enabled. Open Settings menu, then navigate to the docking submenu to show options.
Screenshot 1, "after" in Edge 104: Ensure Focus Mode is enabled. Open Settings menu to show DevTools docking location and Activity Bar location settings. -->

You can now change the orientation of the Quick View panel as well. To change Quick View to a vertical split, select the location toggle (**Dock Quick View to the right**). Selecting this toggle a second time will return Quick View to a horizontal split.

## Improved reliability in Issues tool

<!-- Title: Improved reliability in Issues tool -->
<!-- Subtitle: Improved reliability in Issues tool. -->

In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, there was a bug that sometimes resulted in issues not appearing in the **Issues** tool.  This bug has been fixed, resulting in improved reliability of the **Issues** tool.
