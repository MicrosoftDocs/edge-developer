# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 106)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Introducing the Command Palette

<!-- Subtitle: Your favorite browser management and DevTools commands in one place. -->

In Microsoft Edge 106, you can now enable and use the Command Palette experiment.  Command Palette makes it possible to access browser management and developer tools commands with just one keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar**.


To enable the Command Palette experiment:

1. Go to `edge://flags`.  Then in the **Search flags** text field, start typing **Command Palette**.

1. In the **Command Palette** dropdown menu, select **Enabled**:

   <!-- screenshot directly in What's New, to show where to see the keyboard shortcut along with version:-->
   ![The keyboard shortcut for Command Palette in the flags page for version 106](./devtools-106-images/command-palette-flags-shortcut-106.png)

   Note the keyboard shortcut, which is shown in the **Command Palette** section on the `edge://flags` page.
   <!--
   *  In Microsoft Edge 106 and most releases of 107, the keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar**.
   *  In Microsoft Edge 108 and later, the shortcut is **Ctrl+Q**. -->

1. Click the **Restart** button, which appears in the lower right when you select **Enabled**.

   For more information, see [Enable Command Palette](../../../experimental-features/edge-command-palette.md#enable-command-palette) in _Run commands via keyboard with Command Palette_.


To quickly access the available browser management commands and DevTools commands, after you've enabled the experiment:

1. In Microsoft Edge (with or without DevTools open), press **Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar**.

1. Start typing.  The commands are filtered based on your input characters, and are grouped into categories such as **Suggestions**, **History**, and **DevTools**:

   ![Microsoft Edge Command Palette](./devtools-106-images/command-palette.png)

1. To narrow the filtering to list DevTools commands only, type the greater-than (**>**) character:

   ![Microsoft Edge Command Palette entering `>` to select DevTools commands](./devtools-106-images/command-palette-devtools.png)


Let us know what commands you'd like to see in future versions of Microsoft Edge, by posting a comment in [Issue 73: [feedback] Command Palette experiment](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevTools/issues/73) in the **MicrosoftEdge/DevTools** repo!

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Filter and automatically fix code issues in DevTools for Visual Studio Code

<!-- Subtitle: Let Visual Studio Code fix web issues for you or tell it never to bother you about them again. -->
 
The Microsoft Edge DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code now provides **Quick Fix** options, allowing you to fix issues automatically.

To access the **Quick Fix** options:

1. Hover over an issue that's reported by the DevTools extension, indicated by a wavy underline in your code.  A lightbulb icon appears next to the issue.

1. Click the lightbulb (![lightbulb icon](./devtools-106-images/lightbulb-icon.png)) icon.  The **Quick Fix** menu appears:

   ![Quick Fix options](./devtools-106-images/quick-fix-options.png)

1. Select whichever **Quick Fix** you want to use to resolve the issue or to stop reporting it as an issue.  Selecting to ignore the issue automatically creates a `.hintrc` file which tells the extension to ignore this issue type and not report it again.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## DevTools now uses less disk space when caching sourcemaps

<!-- Subtitle: In Microsoft Edge 106, sourcemaps are now removed from IndexedDB storage if they haven't been accessed in 30 days. -->

Starting in [Microsoft Edge 101](../../../whats-new/2022/04/devtools-101.md#source-maps-are-now-cached-with-indexeddb), DevTools began caching sourcemaps in IndexedDB to reduce the amount of network requests fetching your sourcemaps.  However, this change could potentially take up a lot of disk space if these sourcemaps are never removed.

In Microsoft Edge 106, this issue has been fixed, by removing any sourcemaps that haven't been accessed in 30 days from IndexedDB storage.  Additionally, sourcemaps served from `localhost` are also no longer cached.  Thank you for sending us feedback about this issue!

To understand how DevTools fetches and caches your sourcemaps, watch the **Load status** column in the [Source Maps Monitor tool](../../../source-maps-monitor/source-maps-monitor-tool.md).  When you first load the webpage, the **Source Maps Monitor** tool shows that the source maps aren't cached yet:

![Source Maps Monitor tool, upon first load](./devtools-106-images/source-maps-indexeddb-first-load.png)

When you refresh the webpage, the **Source Maps Monitor** tool shows that the cached source maps are used:

![Source Maps Monitor tool, upon second load](./devtools-106-images/source-maps-indexeddb-second-load.png)

To clear the IndexedDB cache and force DevTools to re-load sourcemaps, run the **Clear source maps cache** command in the Command Menu.  See [Run commands in the Command Menu](../../../command-menu/index.md).

For history, see [Issue 89](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevTools/issues/89).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Chromium color themes have been deprecated

<!-- Subtitle: Users of Chromium themes in DevTools will be automatically migrated to the default dark or light theme for a more reliable experience. -->

To improve reliability, the **Chromium Light** and **Chromium Dark** themes have been deprecated.  Users who previously had these themes selected will be automatically migrated to the **Light+** or **Dark+** theme, respectively:

DevTools in **Light+** theme: 

![DevTools in Light+ theme](./devtools-106-images/light-plus-theme.png)

DevTools in **Dark+** theme:

![DevTools in Dark+ theme](./devtools-106-images/dark-plus-theme.png)

There are many DevTools color themes to choose from, such as **Monokai** and **Solarized**.  To change the color theme in DevTools, click the **Settings** (![Settings icon](./devtools-106-images/settings-gear-icon-light-theme.png)) button, and then in the **Preferences** page, in the **Theme** dropdown menu, select a theme:

## Accessibility improvements in Focus Mode and high contrast mode

<!-- Subtitle: The new Dock location and Activity Bar location buttons in Focus Mode now work better with screen readers, and computed styles are easier to see in high contrast mode. -->


#### Dock location and Activity Bar location buttons in Focus Mode now work better with screen readers

In Microsoft Edge 105, Focus Mode received several improvements, including new **Dock location** and **Activity Bar location** buttons.  In Microsoft Edge 106, these new buttons now work better with assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

Screen readers now announce which **Dock location** button or which **Activity Bar location** button is currently selected, and the number of buttons, representing the available location options:

#### Computed styles are easier to see in high contrast mode

In high contrast mode, in previous versions of Microsoft Edge, the expand and collapse buttons for computed styles didn't render correctly, in the **Computed** tab in the **Elements** tool.  In Microsoft Edge 106, this issue has been fixed.  The expand and collapse buttons are now visible in high contrast mode:
