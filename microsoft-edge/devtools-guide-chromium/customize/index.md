# Customize DevTools

This page lists the ways to customize Microsoft Edge DevTools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Settings

**Settings** > **Preferences** contains many options for customizing DevTools.

To open Settings, in DevTools, click the **Customize and control DevTools** icon (![Customize and control DevTools icon](./index-images/customize-icon.png)), and then click **Settings** (![Settings icon](./index-images/settings-icon.png)).  Or, while DevTools has focus, press **F1**.

![Settings](./index-images/settings-preferences.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Quick View

In the **Quick View** toolbar in the bottom of DevTools, you can select which tools to display.

To open (or close) the **Quick View** panel, press **Esc** when focus is on DevTools.

You can move tools between the **Activity Bar** (at the top) and the **Quick View** toolbar (at the bottom).

*  To move a tool from the **Quick View** toolbar to the **Activity Bar**, right-click a tool, and then select **Move to top Activity Bar**:

   ![Moving a tool from the Quick View toolbar to the Activity Bar](./index-images/move-from-quick-view.png)

*  To move a tool from the **Activity Bar** to the **Quick View** toolbar, right-click a tool, and then select **Move to bottom Quick View**:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Reorder tools

To change the ordering of tabs on a toolbar, drag a tool's tab to the desired location.  Your custom tool order persists across DevTools sessions.

For example, by default, the **Network** tool is the fifth tab on the **Activity Bar**.  You can drag the **Network** tab to become the first tab:

![Custom order of DevTools in a toolbar](./index-images/network-first-position.png)

Tabs that are added by DevTools extensions are always added to the end of the **Activity Bar**.  You can reorder them during a DevTools session, but they will always be at the end of the **Activity Bar** again when DevTools is opened.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open and close tools

To keep the DevTools interface streamlined, many of the tools aren't opened by default.  To open a tool in the **Activity Bar** or the **Quick View** toolbar, click the **More Tools** (![More Tools](./index-images/open-tab-icon.png)) button to the right of the tabs, and then select a tool from the list:

![The More Tools (+) button to open a new tool](./index-images/open-tool-in-activity-bar.png)

To close a tool, right-click a tool's tab and then select **Remove from Activity Bar** or **Remove from Quick View**:

![The tab's Close button](./index-images/close-tool-in-activity-bar.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Change where DevTools is docked in the browser

To change where DevTools is docked in the browser, click the **Customize and control DevTools** icon (![Customize and control DevTools icon](./index-images/customize-icon.png)) and choose one of the options in the **Dock location** submenu:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Color themes

See [Apply a color theme to DevTools](theme.md).

![Selecting a different color theme](./index-images/theme-setting.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Restore default settings

To restore the default theme, placement, tools order, and any other customized settings, select **Settings** > **Preferences**, scroll down, and then click **Restore defaults and refresh**:
