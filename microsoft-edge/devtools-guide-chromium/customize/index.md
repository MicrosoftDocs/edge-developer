# Customize DevTools

This page lists the ways to customize Microsoft Edge DevTools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Settings

**Settings** > **Preferences** contains many options for customizing DevTools.

To open Settings, in DevTools, click the **Settings** icon (![Settings icon](../media/settings-icon-dark.msft.png)).  Or, while DevTools has focus, press `F1`.

![Settings](../media/customize-settings-preferences.msft.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Drawer

In the **Drawer** toolbar in the bottom of DevTools, you can select which tools to display.

To open (or close) the **Drawer**, press `Escape`.

![The Drawer](../media/customize-drawer-open.msft.png)

You can move tools between the main panel and the drawer.

*  To move a tool from the drawer to the main panel, right-click a tool, and then select **Move to top**.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Reorder tools

Click and drag a tool to change the ordering.  Your custom tool order persists across DevTools sessions.

By default, the **Network** tool is usually the fifth tab on the main toolbar.  In the following figure, the **Network** tool is being moved to become the first tab in the main toolbar.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open and close tools

To keep the DevTools interface streamlined, many of the tools aren't opened by default.  To open a tool in the main panel or the **Drawer**, click the **More Tools** (![More Tools](../media/open-tab-icon.png)) button to the right of the tabs, and then select a tool from the list.
