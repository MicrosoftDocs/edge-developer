# Force print preview mode

The [print media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) controls how your page looks when printed.  To force your page into print preview mode:

1.  Press `Control`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS) to open the **Command Menu**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Opening the command menu](../media/print-preview-open-command-menu.png)

1.  Type `rendering`, select the **Show Rendering** option, and press `Enter`.
1.  The **Rendering** panel opens in the **Drawer**.
1.  Under **Emulate CSS media type**, choose **print**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![The Rendering panel with the print CSS media type selected](../media/print-preview-css-media-type.png)

From here, you may display and change your CSS, like any other web page.  Navigate to [Get Started With Viewing And Changing CSS](./index.md).
