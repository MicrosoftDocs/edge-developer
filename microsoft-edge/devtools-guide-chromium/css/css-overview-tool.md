### View and fix color contrast issues in the CSS Overview tool -->

The **CSS Overview** tool displays a summary of CSS-related information about the webpage.  This tool lists the colors, fonts, and media queries the webpage uses.  The tool also lists the elements on your page that have color contrast issues, and the unused CSS declarations.  The [CSS Overview Accessible Colors Demo](https://css-overview-accessible-colors-demo.glitch.me) page has an example of a color contrast issue.

To view a list of elements that have a color contrast issue, on **Contrast issues**, click **Text**.  

To open the element in the **Elements** tool, click an element in the list.  To help fix contrast issues, DevTools [automatically provides color suggestions](../whats-new/2020/08/devtools.md#accessible-color-suggestion-in-the-styles-pane).


For updates on this feature in the Chromium open-source project, see Issue [#1120316](https://crbug.com/1120316).
