<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Overview
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#overview -->

The **Performance** tool can display your own performance data, in addition to the browser's built-in metrics.  Displaying your own custom performance data in the **Performance** tool can be useful in cases such as when you are:

* Building a framework and you need to visualize internal processes.
* Developing a library and you want to track the impact of your code.
* Building a complex web application with a lot of client-side processing.
    
The performance extensibility APIs make it possible to understand what's happening in your code.

By injecting custom measurements and events, you can create tailored visualizations within the **Performance** tool.

The performance extensibility APIs are two approaches to achieve this:

1. **The `console.timeStamp` API (extended for DevTools)**

   This API provides a high-performance method for instrumenting applications and surfacing timing data exclusively to the **Performance** tool in DevTools.  It's designed for minimal runtime overhead, making it suitable for instrumenting hot paths and production builds.  It does not add entries to the browser's internal performance timeline.

1. **The User Timings API (using `performance.mark` and `performance.measure`)**

   This API leverages the existing [User Timings API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/User_timing).  It also adds entries to the browser's internal performance timeline, allowing for further analysis and integration with other performance tools; see [Performance APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance_API) at MDN.

![An example of how custom tracks look in the Performance tool](./extension-images/example.png)<!-- copy of expanded-custom-tracks.png -->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Key benefits
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#key_benefits -->

Both APIs offer:

* **Custom Tracks:** Add dedicated tracks and track groups, in a performance profile, to represent the unique performance aspects of your code.

* **Entries:** Populate these tracks with entries that clearly mark important events or the duration of specific operation.

* **Color Customization:** Use color-coding to visually distinguish different types of events or measurements at a glance.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Choose the right API
<!-- heading not upstream -->

The `console.timeStamp` and User Timings API serve different needs.

Use the `console.timeStamp` API when:

* Performance impact of instrumentation is a primary concern, especially in production builds.

* You need a quick and efficient way to mark durations or events without the need for extra metadata.

* You only need the data to be visualized within the **Performance** tool.

Use the User Timings API (`performance.mark`, `performance.measure`) when:

* You need to store extra data with each entry, and when you are already using the User Timings API.

* You need to associate rich data (tooltips, detailed properties) with your performance entries.

* You want to add visual markers to highlight specific moments.

* You require the data to be available not only in DevTools but also in the browser's internal performance timeline for broader analysis or other tools.

* You're already familiar with or using the User Timings API.

The Photo Gallery demo demonstrates all of these APIs.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Inject your data with `console.timeStamp`
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#inject_your_data_with_consoletimestamp -->

The `console.timeStamp` API is extended to allow for the creation of custom timing entries in the **Performance** tool with minimal overhead, especially when DevTools is not recording a trace.

Syntax:

```javascript
console.timeStamp(label: string, 
                  start?: string|number, 
                  end?: string|number, 
                  trackName?: string, 
                  trackGroup?: string, 
                  color?: DevToolsColor);
```

* `label`:

   The label for the timing entry.

* `start` (optional):

   * If defined as a string: the name of a previously recorded timestamp (using `console.timeStamp(timeStampName)`).

   * If defined as a number: a timestamp in milliseconds relative to [Performance.timeOrigin](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/timeOrigin) (for example, taken with [performance.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)) that represents the start time of the timing entry.

   * If undefined, the current time is used as start time.

* `end`:

   * If defined as a string: The name of a previously recorded timestamp.

   * If defined as a number: a timestamp in milliseconds relative to [Performance.timeOrigin](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/timeOrigin) (for example, taken with [performance.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)) that represents the end time of the timing entry.

   * If undefined, the current time is used as end time.

* `trackName`:

   The name of the custom track.

* `trackGroup`:

   The name of the track group.

* `color`:

   The color of the entry.

* [Specification for console.timeStamp Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juT7esZ62ydio-SQwEVsY7pdidKhjAphvUghWrlw0II/edit?tab=t.0) - 6-parameter version of the method.
   * [console: timeStamp() static method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/console/timeStamp_static) - 1-parameter version of the method.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Inject your data with the User Timings API
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#inject_your_data_with_the_user_timings_api -->

To inject custom data, include a `devtools` object within the `detail` property of [performance.mark](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark#detail) and [performance.measure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure#detail) methods.  The structure of this `devtools` object determines how your data is displayed in the **Performance** tool.

* Use [performance.mark](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark) to record an instant event or timestamp in the timeline.  You can mark the start or end of a specific operation or any point of interest that doesn't have a duration.  When you include a `devtools` object within the `detail` property, the **Performance** tool shows a custom marker in the **Timings** track.

* Use [performance.measure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure) to measure the duration of a task or process.  When you include a `devtools` object within the `detail` property, the **Performance** tool shows custom measurement entries in the timeline in a custom track.  If you're using `performance.mark` as a reference point to create a `performance.measure`, you don't need to include the `devtools` object in `performance.mark` calls.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `devtools` object
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#devtools_object -->

<!-- resume -->

These types define the structure of the `devtools` object for different extension features:

```javascript
type DevToolsColor =
  "primary" | "primary-light" | "primary-dark" |
  "secondary" | "secondary-light" | "secondary-dark" |
  "tertiary" | "tertiary-light" | "tertiary-dark" |
  "error";

interface ExtensionTrackEntryPayload {
  dataType?: "track-entry";        // Defaults to "track-entry"
  color?: DevToolsColor;           // Defaults to "primary"
  track: string;                   // Required: Name of the custom track
  trackGroup?: string;             // Optional: Group for organizing tracks
  properties?: [string, string][]; // Key-value pairs for detailed view
  tooltipText?: string;            // Short description for tooltip
}

interface ExtensionMarkerPayload {
  dataType: "marker";              // Required: Identifies as a marker
  color?: DevToolsColor;           // Defaults to "primary"
  properties?: [string, string][]; // Key-value pairs for detailed view
  tooltipText?: string;            // Short description for tooltip
}
```

## View your custom data in the performance profile
<!-- View your data in the timeline  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#view-custom-data -->
<!-- how to view a custom track, not how to create it -->

To see your custom data in a recorded performance profile, in the **Performance** tool, first use one of the performance extensibility APIs, and then record a profile.  The [Photo Gallery demo page](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/photo-gallery/) already uses the performance extensibility APIs, as demonstrated and then explained below.

To record a profile and view the custom performance data of the Photo Gallery demo page:

1. Open the [Photo Gallery demo page](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/photo-gallery/) in a new window or tab.

   Or, to be able to modify the sample code:
   1. Clone the "MicrosoftEdge / Demos" repo, per [Clone the Edge Demos repo to your drive](../sample-code/sample-code.md#clone-the-edge-demos-repo-to-your-drive).
   1. Start a localhost server in the cloned `demos/photo-gallery` directory, per [Start the localhost server](../sample-code/sample-code.md#start-the-localhost-server), in _Sample code for DevTools_.
   1. In the browser, go to `http://localhost:8080` or equivalent, in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click the demo webpage, and then select **Inspect**.

   DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, select the **Performance** (![Performance icon](./extension-images/performance-icon.png)) tool.

1. In the **Performance** tool, click the **Capture settings** (![Capture settings icon](./extension-images/capture-settings-icon.png)) button, and then make sure that the **Show custom tracks** checkbox is selected:

   ![The 'Show custom tracks' checkbox in the 'Capture settings' of the Performance tool](./extension-images/custom-tracks-setting.png)

1. Click the **Record** (![Record icon](./extension-images/record-icon.png)) button.

1. Reload the page.

1. Change the camera model filter.  For example, at the top of the demo page, in the **Camera** dropdown menu on the left, change from **All** to **Apple iPhone 12**.

1. Click a photo, such as the first photo.

   The photo expands.

1. In DevTools, click the **Stop** button.

   The profile is displayed.

1. Scroll down to the **Custom performance timings â Custom track** track group, and expand it.

   The following custom tracks are shown:
   * **Console timestamp track**
   * **Photo creation**
   * **Filtering**
   * **Loading**

1. Expand each of these four tracks.

1. Use the mouse and arrow keys to shift and zoom the profile, to display the custom performance measures:

   ![Expanded custom tracks](./extension-images/expanded-custom-tracks.png)

1. Hover over a marker in a custom track, such as a **Loading** marker in the **Loading** track.

   A custom tooltip is displayed, including duration and caption.

1. Select a marker in a custom track.

   In the **Summary** tab at the bottom of the **Performance** tool, details are shown for the marker.

The code that defines these custom performance measures is shown in [Add custom tracks and entries to the timeline (`performance.measure()`)](#add-custom-tracks-and-entries-to-the-timeline-performancemeasure), below.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Code examples
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#code_examples -->

Below are a few examples of how to use the API to add your own data to the **Performance** tool by using each available mechanism.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `console.timeStamp` API examples
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#consoletimestamp_api_examples -->

In the `populateGallery()` function of the Photo Gallery demo, `console.timeStamp()` is used as follows:

```javascript
function populateGallery(images) {
...
    const perfMeasureDescription = `Image ${file} created`;
    performance.measure(perfMeasureDescription, {
      start: imageCreationStart,
      end: performance.now(),
      detail: {
        devtools: {
          dataType: "track-entry",
          color: "primary",
          trackGroup: customPerformanceTrackGroupName,
          track: "Photo creation",
          properties: [
            ['File', file],
            ['Width', w],
            ['Height', h],
            ['User', user],
          ],
          tooltipText: perfMeasureDescription
        }
      },
    });

    console.timeStamp("Photo created",                 // label
                      imageCreationStart,              // start
                      undefined,                       // end
                      "Console timestamp track",       // trackName
                      customPerformanceTrackGroupName, // trackGroup
                      "tertiary-dark");                // color
```

In the `loadPhoto()` function of the Photo Gallery demo, `console.timeStamp()` is used as follows:

```javascript
function loadPhoto(fileName) {
  const loadStartTime = performance.now();
  const perfMeasureDescription = `Loading photo: ${fileName}`;

  return new Promise(resolve => {
    const imageEl = document.createElement("img");
    imageEl.src = fileName;
    imageEl.addEventListener('load', () => {
      performance.measure(perfMeasureDescription, {
        start: loadStartTime,
        end: performance.now(),
        detail: {
          devtools: {
            dataType: "track-entry",
            color: "tertiary",
            trackGroup: customPerformanceTrackGroupName,
            track: "Loading",
            properties: [
              ['Photo', fileName]
            ],
            tooltipText: perfMeasureDescription
          }
        },
      });

      performance.mark("Photo loaded", {
        detail: {
          devtools: {
            dataType: "marker",
            color: "secondary",
            properties: [
              ['Photo', fileName]
            ],
            tooltipText: "Photo Loaded"
          }
        }
      });

      console.timeStamp("Photo loaded",                  // label
                        loadStartTime,                   // start
                        undefined,                       // end
                        "Console timestamp track",       // trackName
                        customPerformanceTrackGroupName, // trackGroup
                        "primary-light");                // color

      resolve(imageEl);
    }, { once: true });
  });
}
```

**Example 2 (not used in `\Demos\photo-gallery\gallery.js`):**

```javascript
// Record the start timestamp of some task.
const start = performance.now();

// Later, once the task has been done, record the end timestamp by using console.timeStamp.
// Because the end timestamp is undefined, the value of performance.now() will be used.
console.timeStamp("measure 1", start, undefined, "My Track", "My Group", "primary-light");

// Alternatively, you can provide an end timestamp.
const end = performance.now();
console.timeStamp("measure 2", start, end, "My Track", "My Group", "secondary-dark");
```

This results in the following custom track entry in the performance timeline:

![A custom track with custom entries added with the console.timeStamp API](./extension-images/custom-track-console-timestamp.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### User Timings API examples
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#user_timings_api_examples -->

In the next sections, see the examples of code that showcase how to add the following to the performance timeline:
* [Add custom tracks and entries to the timeline (`performance.measure()`)](#add-custom-tracks-and-entries-to-the-timeline-performancemeasure)
* [Add markers to the Timings track (`performance.mark()`)](#add-markers-to-the-timings-track-performancemark)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add custom tracks and entries to the timeline (`performance.measure()`)
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#tracks -->

Create custom tracks and populate them with entries to visualize your performance data in a custom track.

<!-- not upstream: -->
For example, the above Photo Gallery demo uses the [performance.measure()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure#detail) method from the User Timings API.  (The provided demo doesn't use `performance.mark()` or the `console.timeStamp` API.)

Below are excerpts from the demo's source code and which keywords are used for custom perf data, from [photo-gallery/gallery.js](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/blob/main/photo-gallery/gallery.js):

Define a custom performance track group name:

```javascript
const customPerformanceTrackGroupName = "Custom performance timings";
```

Define image creation start time:

```javascript
const imageCreationStart = performance.now();
```

To inject custom data, a `devtools` object is defined within the `detail` property of the `performance.measure` method, at start of image creation:

```javascript
const perfMeasureDescription = `Image ${file} created`;
performance.measure(perfMeasureDescription, {
   start: imageCreationStart,
   end: performance.now(),
   detail: {
      devtools: {
         dataType: "track-entry",
         color: "primary",
         trackGroup: customPerformanceTrackGroupName,
         track: "Photo creation",
         properties: [
            ['File', file],
            ['Width', w],
            ['Height', h],
            ['User', user],
         ],
         tooltipText: perfMeasureDescription
      }
   },
});

console.timeStamp("Photo created",                 // label
                  imageCreationStart,              // start
                  undefined,                       // end
                  "Console timestamp track",       // trackName
                  customPerformanceTrackGroupName, // trackGroup
                  "tertiary-dark");                // color
```

Define the filter start time:

```javascript
const filterStartTime = performance.now();
```

The Photo Gallery demo includes a `devtools` object within the `detail` property of the `performance.measure` method for when a filter is selected, to show a subset of photos:

```javascript
const description = `Filter applied: ${filter.id}`;
performance.measure(description, {
   start: filterStartTime,
   end: performance.now(),
   detail: {
      devtools: {
         dataType: "track-entry",
         color: "secondary",
         trackGroup: customPerformanceTrackGroupName,
         track: "Filtering",
         properties: [
            ['Filter Value', filter.value]
         ],
         tooltipText: description
      }
   },
});
```

In the demo's `loadPhoto()` function, set the photo load start time and the "loading photo" description:

```javascript
const loadStartTime = performance.now();
const perfMeasureDescription = `Loading photo: ${fileName}`;
```

In the demo's `loadPhoto()` function, in the `load` event listener, a `devtools` object is defined within the `performance.measure()` call:

```javascript
performance.measure(perfMeasureDescription, {
   start: loadStartTime,
   end: performance.now(),
   detail: {
      devtools: {
         dataType: "track-entry",
         color: "tertiary",
         trackGroup: customPerformanceTrackGroupName,
         track: "Loading",
         properties: [
            ['Photo', fileName]
         ],
         tooltipText: perfMeasureDescription
      }
   },
});
```

The result is shown in [View your custom data in the performance profile](#view-your-custom-data-in-the-performance-profile), above.


<!-- ---------- -->
**Example 2 (not used in photo-gallery demo):**

```javascript
// Mark used to represent the start of the image processing task
// The start time is defaulted to now
const imageProcessingTimeStart = performance.now();

// ... later in your code

// Track entry representing the completion of image processing
// with additional details and a tooltip
// The start time is a marker from earlier
// The end time is defaulted to now
performance.measure("Image Processing Complete", {
  start: imageProcessingTimeStart,
  detail: {
    devtools: {
      dataType: "track-entry",
      track: "Image Processing Tasks",
      trackGroup: "My Tracks", // Group related tracks together
      color: "tertiary-dark",
      properties: [
        ["Filter Type", "Gaussian Blur"],
        ["Resize Dimensions", "500x300"]
      ],
      tooltipText: "Image processed successfully"
    }
  }
});
```


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add markers to the Timings track (`performance.mark()`)
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/extension#markers -->

Visually highlight specific points of interest in the timeline with custom markers that span across all tracks.

For example, from `\Demos\photo-gallery\gallery.js`:

<!-- not upstream -->
Within the `addEventListener('input', e => {` body, below the `performance.measure()` call, is the following `performance.mark()` call:

```javascript
performance.mark("Filter Applied", {
   detail: {
      devtools: {
         dataType: "marker",
         color: "secondary",
         properties: [
            ['Filter Value', filter.value]
         ],
         tooltipText: "Filter Applied"
      }
   }
});
```

Within the `function loadPhoto()` body, below the `performance.measure()` call, is the following `performance.mark()` call:

```javascript
performance.mark("Photo loaded", {
   detail: {
      devtools: {
      dataType: "marker",
      color: "secondary",
      properties: [
         ['Photo', fileName]
      ],
      tooltipText: "Photo Loaded"
      }
   }
});

console.timeStamp("Photo loaded",                  // label
                  loadStartTime,                   // start
                  undefined,                       // end
                  "Console timestamp track",       // trackName 
                  customPerformanceTrackGroupName, // trackGroup 
                  "primary-light");                // color
```

This results in the **Filter Applied** and **Photo Loaded** markers in the **Timings** track, along with tooltip text and properties:

![Custom markers in the Timings track: "Filter Applied" and "Photo Loaded"](./extension-images/marker-in-timings.png)


<!-- ---------- -->
**Example 3, not used in photo-gallery demo:**

```javascript
// Marker indicating when the processed image was uploaded
performance.mark("Image Upload", {
  detail: {
    devtools: {
      dataType: "marker",
      color: "secondary",
      properties: [
        ["Image Size", "2.5MB"],
        ["Upload Destination", "Cloud Storage"]
      ],
      tooltipText: "Processed image uploaded"
    }
  }
});
```
