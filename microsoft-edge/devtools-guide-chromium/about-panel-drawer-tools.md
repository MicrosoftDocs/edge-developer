# About Panel and Drawer tools

The tools that are listed in this **Tools** section can be displayed either as a Panel tool (on the main toolbar) or a Drawer tool (on the Drawer toolbar).  In the **Command Menu**, each of these tools is labelled as either a **Panel** tool or as a **Drawer** tool.  But you can add them to either the main toolbar or the Drawer toolbar, and you can use any of the following methods to open them or move them between the two toolbars.

<!-- Use the **More Tools** (**+**) menu to select any of the Panel tools or Drawer tools.  The **More Tools** menu appears in two places:
*  On the main toolbar at the top of DevTools (where _Panel_ tools usually go).
*  On the **Drawer** toolbar (where _Drawer_ tools usually go). -->
