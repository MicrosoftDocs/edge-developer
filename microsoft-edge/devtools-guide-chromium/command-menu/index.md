# Run commands with the Microsoft Edge DevTools Command Menu

The Command Menu provides a fast way to navigate the Microsoft Edge DevTools UI and accomplish common tasks, such as [disabling JavaScript](../javascript/disable.md).  You may be familiar with a similar feature in Microsoft Visual Studio Code called the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), which was the original inspiration for the Command Menu.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open the Command Menu

Select `Control`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS). Or choose **Customize And Control DevTools** (`...`) > **Run Command**.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Display other available actions

If you use the workflow outlined in [Open the Command Menu](#open-the-command-menu), the Command Menu opens with a `>` character pre-pended to the Command Menu text box.
