# Run commands in the Command Menu

The Command Menu provides a fast way to navigate the Microsoft Edge DevTools UI and accomplish common tasks.  The Command Menu is similar to the [Command Palette in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette):

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open the Command Menu

To open the Command Menu:

*  Click the **Customize and control DevTools** (![Customize icon](../media/customize-devtools-icon-light-theme.png)) menu button, and then select **Run command**:

   Or, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS).



<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Display other available actions

The Command Menu initially opens with a `>` character prepended to its text box:

To show other actions that are available from the Command Menu, delete the `>` character and then type **?**:
