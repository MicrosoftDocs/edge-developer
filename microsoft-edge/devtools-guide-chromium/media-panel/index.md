# View and debug media players information

Use the **Media** tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools to view information and debug the media players per browser tab.

The **Media** tool is the main place in DevTools for inspecting the media player of a webpage.

## Hide and show media players

Sometimes you run more than one media player on a webpage, or use the same browser tab to browse different webpages, each with media players.

You may choose to hide (or show) each media player for an easier debugging experience.

1.  Browse to several different video webpages using the same browser tab.
1.  To hide media players, complete one of the following actions.
    *   To hide one media player, hover on a media player, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Hide player**.
    *   To hide all of the other media players, hover on a media player, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Hide all others**.

    :::image type="complex" source="../media/media-panel-hide-show.msft.png" alt-text="Hide media players" lightbox="../media/media-panel-hide-show.msft.png":::
       Hide media players
    :::image-end:::


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Export media player information

1.  To download the media player info as a JSON file, hover on a media player, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Save player info**.

    :::image type="complex" source="../media/media-panel-save.msft.png" alt-text="Export media information" lightbox="../media/media-panel-save.msft.png":::
       Export media information
    :::image-end:::
