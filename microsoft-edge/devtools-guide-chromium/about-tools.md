<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Additional ways to access the tools

The following features are additional ways to access the tools:

* The **Quick View** panel is an additional toolbar and area to hold tools, below or to the right of the **Activity Bar** panel.

* The **Command Menu** is a way to directly use features of tools.

* The **Settings** pages can turn on additional features of tools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Experimental tools

Microsoft Edge DevTools potentially includes additional tools, if you select the experiment's check box in DevTools **Settings > Experiments**.  For example:

| Tool | Purpose | Article |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Protocol monitor** | Displays the DevTools protocol messages that are sent and received by DevTools, to debug the inspected page. | [Protocol Monitor](./experimental-features/index.md#protocol-monitor) in _Experimental features_. |
<!-- 2025/02/19: exists: Experiments > **Protocol Monitor** checkbox  -->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Activity Bar tools vs. Quick View tools

_Activity Bar tools_ are tools that open in the **Activity Bar** (the upper pane) by default.  _Quick View_ tools are tools that open in the **Quick View** panel (the lower pane) by default.  To show or hide the **Quick View** panel: when focus is on DevTools, press **Esc**.

The **Command Menu** first lists the **Activity Bar** tools (indicated by the **Panel** label), and then the **Quick View** tools:

![The Command Menu, showing the Panel tools grouped together, and then the Quick View tools](./about-tools-images/command-menu-panel-vs-quick-view-tools.png)

To move a tool to the other toolbar, right-click the tool's tab and then select **Move to bottom Quick View**, **Move to side Quick View**, **Move to top Activity Bar**, or **Move to left Activity Bar**:

![The right-click menu for a tool in the Quick View toolbar, including the 'Move to top Activity Bar' command](./about-tools-images/move-from-quickview-to-activitybar.png)

To open the **Command Menu**, press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Shift+P** (macOS).  Or, click the **Customize and control DevTools** (![Customize icon](./about-tools-images/customize-devtools-icon-light-theme.png)) button and then select **Run command**.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Closing tool tabs

To close a tool tab that's on a toolbar, right-click the tab, and then select **Remove from Activity Bar** or **Remove from Quick View**:

![The right-click menu for the Network tool in the Activity Bar, including the 'Remove from Activity Bar' command](./about-tools-images/remove-from-activitybar.png)

The **Elements**, **Console**, and **Sources** tools are permanent tabs and cannot be closed or moved from the **Activity Bar** to the **Quick View** panel.  You can drag their tabs to reorder them in the **Activity Bar**.

The **Console** tool is also a permanent tab on the **Quick View** toolbar.  In contrast, the **Issues** tool on the **Quick View** toolbar can be removed.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Restoring the default tool tabs

To restore all of the default tool tabs in the **Activity Bar** and **Quick View**:

1. In DevTools, select **Customize and control DevTools** (![Customize and control DevTools icon](./about-tools-images/customize-devtools-icon-light-theme.png)) > **Settings** (![Settings icon](./about-tools-images/settings-gear-icon-light-theme.png)) > **Preferences**.

1. Click the **Restore defaults and refresh** button.  DevTools restarts, and the default tabs appear in both toolbars.
