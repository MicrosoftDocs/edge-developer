# JavaScript Debugging Reference   



Discover new debugging workflows with this comprehensive reference of Microsoft Edge DevTools debugging features.  

See [Get Started With Debugging JavaScript In Microsoft Edge DevTools][DevToolsJavascriptGetStarted] to learn the basics of debugging.  

## Pause code with breakpoints   

Set a breakpoint so that you are able to pause your code in the middle of the runtime.  

See [Pause Your Code With Breakpoints][DevToolsJavascriptBreakpoints] to learn how to set breakpoints.  

[DevToolsJavascriptBreakpoints]: breakpoints.md "How To Pause Your Code With Breakpoints In Microsoft Edge DevTools"  

## Step through code   

Once your code is paused, step through it, one line at a time, investigating control flow and property values along the way.  

### Step over line of code   

When paused on a line of code containing a function that is not relevant to the problem you are debugging, click on the **Step over** ![Step over][ImageStepOverIcon] icon to run the function without stepping into it.  

> ##### Figure 1  
> Selecting **Step over**  
> ![Selecting Step over][ImageSelectingStepOver]  

For example, suppose you are debugging the following code:  

```javascript
function updateHeader() {
    var day = new Date().getDay();
    var name = getName(); // A
    updateName(name); // D
}
function getName() {
    var name = app.first + ' ' + app.last; // B
    return name; // C
}
```  

You are paused on `A`.  By pressing **Step over**, DevTools runs all the code in the function that you are stepping over, which is `B` and `C`.  DevTools then pauses on `D`.  

### Step into line of code   

When paused on a line of code containing a function call that is related to the problem you are debugging, click on the **Step into** ![Step into][ImageStepIntoIcon] icon to investigate that function further.  

> ##### Figure 2  
> Selecting **Step into**  
> ![Selecting Step into][ImageSelectingStepInto]  

For example, suppose you are debugging the following code:  

```javascript
function updateHeader() {
    var day = new Date().getDay();
    var name = getName(); // A
    updateName(name);
}
function getName() {
    var name = app.first + ' ' + app.last; // B
    return name;
}
```  

You are paused on `A`.  By pressing **Step into**, DevTools runs this line of code, then pauses on `B`.  

### Step out of line of code   

When paused inside of a function that is not related to the problem you are debugging, click on the **Step out** ![Step out][ImageStepOutIcon] icon to run the rest of the code of the function.  

> ##### Figure 3  
> Selecting **Step out**  
> ![Selecting Step out][ImageSelectingStepOut]  

For example, suppose you are debugging the following code:  

```javascript
function updateHeader() {
    var day = new Date().getDay();
    var name = getName();
    updateName(name); // C
}
function getName() {
    var name = app.first + ' ' + app.last; // A
    return name; // B
}
```  

You are paused on `A`.  By pressing **Step out**, DevTools runs the rest of the code in `getName()`, which is just `B` in this example, and then pauses on `C`.  

### Run all code up to a specific line   

When debugging a long function, there may be a lot of code that is not related to the problem you are debugging.  

You may choose to step through all the lines, but that is tedious.  You may choose to set a line-of-code breakpoint on the line in which you are interested and then click on the **Resume Script Execution** ![Resume Script Execution][ImageResumeScriptExecutionIcon] icon, but there is a faster way.  

Right-click the line of code in which you are interested, and select **Continue to here**.  DevTools runs all of the code up to that point, and then pauses on that line.  

> ##### Figure 4  
> Selecting **Continue to here**  
> ![Selecting Continue to here][ImageSelectingContinueToHere]  

### Restart the top function of the call stack   

While paused on a line of code, right-click anywhere in the **Call Stack** pane and select **Restart Frame** to pause on the first line of the top function in your call stack.  The top function is the last function that was called.  

For example, suppose you are stepping through the following code:  

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    var product = 0; // B
    for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      product += i;
    }
    return product; // A
}
```  

You are paused on `A`.  After clicking **Restart Frame**, you should be paused on `B`, without ever setting a breakpoint or pressing **Resume script execution**.  

> ##### Figure 5  
> Selecting **Restart Frame**  
> ![Selecting Restart Frame][ImageSelectingRestartFrame]  

### Resume script runtime   

To continue the runtime after a pause of your script, click on the **Resume Script Execution** ![Resume Script Execution][ImageResumeScriptExecutionIcon] icon.  DevTools runs the script up until the next breakpoint, if any.  

> ##### Figure 6  
> Selecting **Resume script execution**  
> ![Selecting Resume script execution][ImageSelectingResumeScriptExecution]  

#### Force script runtime   

To ignore all breakpoints and force your script to resume running, click and hold the **Resume Script Execution** ![Resume Script Execution][ImageResumeScriptExecutionIcon] icon and then select **Force script execution** ![Force script execution][ImageForceScriptExecutionIcon].  

> ##### Figure 7  
> Selecting **Force script execution**  
> ![Selecting Force script execution][ImageSelectingForceScriptExecution]  

### Change thread context   

When working with web workers or service workers, click on a context listed in the **Threads** pane to switch to that context.  The blue arrow icon represents which context is currently selected.  

> ##### Figure 8  
> The **Threads** pane  
> ![The Threads pane][ImageThreadsPane]  

For example, suppose that you are paused on a breakpoint in both your main script and your service worker script.  You want to view the local and global properties for the service worker context, but the **Sources** panel is showing the main script context.  By clicking on the service worker entry in the **Threads** pane, you should be able to switch to that context.  

## View and edit local, closure, and global properties   

While paused on a line of code, use the **Scope** pane to view and edit the values of properties and variables in the local, closure, and global scopes.  

*   Double-click a property value to change it.  
*   Non-enumerable properties are greyed out.  

> ##### Figure 9  
> The **Scope** pane  
> ![The Scope pane][ImageScopePane]  

## View the current call stack   

While paused on a line of code, use the **Call Stack** pane to view the call stack that got you to this point.  

<!--If you are working with async code, check the **Async** checkbox to enable async call stacks.  -->  

Click on an entry to jump to the line of code where that function was called.  The blue arrow icon represents which function DevTools is currently highlighting.  

> ##### Figure 10  
> The **Call Stack** pane  
> ![The Call Stack pane][ImageCallStackPane]  

> [!NOTE]
> When not paused on a line of code, the **Call Stack** pane is empty.  

### Copy stack trace   

<!--
This should be moved to an "Export debug data" H2 section when there is enough content for that, but there is not right now, so it is here.
-->

Right-click anywhere in the **Call Stack** pane and select **Copy stack trace** to copy the current call stack to the clipboard.  

> ##### Figure 11  
> Selecting **Copy Stack Trace**  
> ![Selecting Copy Stack Trace][ImageSelectingCopyStackTrace]  

Below is an example of the output:  

```javascript
getNumber1 (get-started.js:35)
inputsAreEmpty (get-started.js:22)
onClick (get-started.js:15)
```  

## Ignore a script or pattern of scripts  

Mark a script as Library code when you want to ignore that script while debugging.  When marked as Library code, a script is obscured in the **Call Stack** pane, and you never step into the functions of the script when you step through your code.  

For example, suppose you are stepping through this code:  

```javascript
function animate() {
    prepare();
    lib.doFancyStuff(); // A
    render();
}
```  

`A` is a third-party library that you trust.  If you are confident that the problem you are debugging is not related to the third-party library, then it makes sense to mark the script as **Library code**.  

### Mark a script as Library code from the Editor pane  

To mark a script as **Library code** from the **Editor** pane:  

1.  Open the file.  
1.  Right-click anywhere.  
1.  Select **Mark as Library code**.  

> ##### Figure 12  
> Marking a script as **Library code** from the **Editor** pane  
> ![Marking a script as Library code from the Editor pane][ImageMarkEditorPane]  

### Mark a script as Library code from the Call Stack pane  

To mark a script as **Library code** from the **Call Stack** pane:  

1.  Right-click on a function from the script.  
1.  Select **Mark as Library code**.  

> ##### Figure 13  
> Marking a script as **Library code** from the **Call Stack** pane  
> ![Marking a script as Library code from the Call Stack pane][ImageMarkCallStackPane]  

### Mark a script as Library code from Settings  

To mark a single script or pattern of scripts from Settings:  

1.  Open [Settings][DevToolsCustomize].  
1.  Go to the **Library code** tab.  
1.  Click **Add pattern**.  
1.  Enter the script name or a regex pattern of script names to mark as **Library code**.  
1.  Click **Add**.  

> ##### Figure 14  
> Marking a script as **Library code** from Settings  
> ![Marking a script as Library code from Settings][ImageMarkScriptSettings]  

## Run snippets of debug code from any page   

If you find yourself running the same debug code in the Console over and over, consider Snippets.  Snippets are runtime scripts that you author, store, and run within DevTools.  

See [Run Snippets of Code From Any Page][DevToolsJavascriptSnippets] to learn more.  

## Watch the values of custom JavaScript expressions   

Use the **Watch** pane to watch the values of custom expressions.  You may watch any valid JavaScript expression.  

> ##### Figure 15  
> The **Watch** pane  
> ![The Watch pane][ImageWatchPane]  

*   Click on the **Add Expression** ![Add Expression][ImageAddExpressionIcon] icon to create a new watch expression.  
*   Click on the **Refresh** ![Refresh][ImageRefreshIcon] icon to refresh the values of all existing expressions.  Values automatically refresh while stepping through code.  
*   Hover over an expression and click on the **Delete Expression** ![Delete Expression][ImageDeleteExpressionIcon] icon to delete it.  

## Make a minified file readable   

Click on the **Format** ![Format][ImageFormatIcon] icon to make a minified file human-readable.  

> ##### Figure 16  
> The **Format** button  
> ![The Format button][ImageFormat]  

## Edit a script   

When fixing a bug, you often want to test out some changes to your JavaScript code.  You do not need to make the changes in an external editor or IDE and then reload the page.  You may edit your script in DevTools.  

To edit a script:  

1.  Open the file in the **Editor** pane of the **Sources** panel.  
1.  Make your changes in the **Editor** pane.  
1.  Press `Ctrl`+`S` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`S` \(macOS\) to save.  DevTools patches the entire JS file into the JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge.
