# Add content scripts to the Ignore List

When you use the **Sources** tool to step through code, sometimes you pause on code that you don't recognize and don't want to step through, such as code for a Microsoft Edge extension that's installed.

To avoid pausing on extension code:

1. In DevTools, in the upper right, click the **Settings** (![Settings icon](./mark-content-scripts-library-code-images/settings-gear-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. In the **Settings** > **Ignore List** page, select the **Add content scripts to ignore list** checkbox:

   ![Enabling the 'Add content scripts to ignore list' checkbox](./mark-content-scripts-library-code-images/javascript-settings-library-code-mark-content-scripts-library-code.png)

1. Click the **Close** DevTools (![Close DevTools icon](./mark-content-scripts-library-code-images/close-devtools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.
