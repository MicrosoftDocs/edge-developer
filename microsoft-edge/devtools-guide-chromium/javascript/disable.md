# Disable JavaScript

To review how your webpage renders when a browser doesn't have JavaScript support, temporarily turn off JavaScript.

Complete the following actions to examine how a webpage displays and behaves when you turn off JavaScript.

1.  [Open Microsoft Edge DevTools](../open/index.md).
1.  Select `Control`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS) to open the **Command Menu**.

       The **Command Menu**
    :::image-end:::

1.  Start typing `javascript`, choose **Disable JavaScript**, and then select `Enter` to run the command.  JavaScript is now disabled.

       Choose **Disable JavaScript** in the **Command Menu**
    :::image-end:::

    The yellow warning icon next to **Sources** reminds you that JavaScript is disabled.

    :::image-end:::

JavaScript remains disabled in the tab for as long as you have DevTools open.

You may want to refresh the page to review if and how the webpage depends on JavaScript while loading.

To re-enable JavaScript, complete the following actions.

*   Open the **Command Menu** again and run the `Enable JavaScript` command.
*   Close DevTools.
