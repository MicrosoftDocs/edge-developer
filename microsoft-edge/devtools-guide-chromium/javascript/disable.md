# Disable JavaScript With Microsoft Edge DevTools   



To see how a web page looks and behaves when JavaScript is disabled:  

1.  [Open Microsoft Edge DevTools][DevToolsOpen].  
1.  Press `Control`+`Shift`+`P` \(Windwos\) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` \(macOS\) to open the **Command Menu**.  
    
    > ##### Figure 1  
    > The Command Menu  
    > ![The Command Menu][ImageCommandMenu]  
    
1.  Start typing `javascript`, select **Disable JavaScript**, and then press `Enter` to run the command.  JavaScript is now disabled.  
    
    > ##### Figure 2  
    > Selecting **Disable JavaScript** in the Command Menu  
    > ![Selecting Disable JavaScript in the Command Menu][ImageDisableJS]  
    
    The yellow warning icon next to **Sources** reminds you that JavaScript is disabled.  
    
    > ##### Figure 3  
    > The warning icon next to **Sources**  
    > ![The warning icon next to Sources][ImageDisableJSWarning]  

JavaScript remains disabled in this tab for as long as you have DevTools open.  

You may want to reload the page to see if and how the page depends on JavaScript while loading.  

To re-enable JavaScript:  

*   Open the **Command Menu** again and run the `Enable JavaScript` command.  
*   Close DevTools.
