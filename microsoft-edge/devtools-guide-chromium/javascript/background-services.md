# Debug Background Services With Microsoft Edge DevTools   



The **Background Services** section of Microsoft Edge DevTools is a collection of tools for the JavaScript APIs that enables your website to send and receive updates even when a user does not have your website open.  
A background service is functionally similar to a [background process][WikiBackgroundProcess].  
Microsoft Edge DevTools considers each of the following APIs to be a background service:  

*   [Background Fetch](#background-fetch)  
*   [Background Sync](#background-sync)  
*   [Notifications](#notifications)  
*   [Push Messages](#push-messages)  

Microsoft Edge DevTools can log background service events for 3 days, even when DevTools is not open.  
This can help you make sure that events are being sent and received as expected.  You can also inspect the details of each event.

## Background Fetch   

The *Background Fetch API** enables a **service worker** to reliably download large resources, like movies or podcasts, as a background service.  To log Background Fetch event for 3 days, even when DevTools is not open:  

<!--Todo: add background fetch api section when available -->  

1.  [Open DevTools][OpenDevTools].  
1.  Open the **Application** panel.  
1.  Open the **Background Fetch** pane.  
    
    > ##### Figure 2  
    > The Background Fetch pane  
    > ![The Background Fetch pane][FetchEmpty]  
    
1.  Click **Record** ![Record][ImageRecordIcon].  
   After triggering some Background Fetch activity, DevTools logs the events to the table.

1.  Click an event to view its details in the space below the table.

## Background Sync   

The **Background Sync API** enables an offline **service worker** to send data to a server once it has re-established a reliable internet connection.  To log Background Sync events for 3 days, even when DevTools is not open:  

<!--Todo: add background sync api section when available -->  

1.  Open **DevTools**.  
1.  Open the **Application** panel.  
1.  Open the **Background Sync** pane.  
    
    > ##### Figure 5  
    > The Background Sync pane  
    > ![The Background Sync pane][SyncEmpty]  
    
1.  Click **Record** ![Record][ImageRecordIcon].  
   After triggering some Background Sync activity, DevTools logs the events to the table.  
    
    > ##### Figure 6  
    > A log of events in the Background Sync pane  
    > ![A log of events in the Background Sync pane][SyncLog]  
    
1.  Click an event to view its details in the space below the table.  
    
    > ##### Figure 7

    > ![Viewing the details of an event in the Background Sync pane][SyncDetails]  
    
<!--Todo: add open devtools section when available -->  

## Notifications 

After a **service worker** has received a [Push Message][MDNPush] from a server, the service worker uses the [Notifications API][MDNNotifications] to display the data to a user.  To log Notifications for 3 days, even when DevTools is not open:  

1.  Open **DevTools**.  
1.  Open the **Application** panel.  
1.  Open the **Notifications** pane.  
    
    > ##### Figure 8  
    > The Notifications pane  
    > ![The Notifications pane][NotificationsEmpty]  
    
1.  Click **Record** ![Record][ImageRecordIcon].  
   After triggering some Notifications activity, DevTools logs the events to the table.  
    
    > ##### Figure 9  
    > A log of events in the Notifications pane  
    > ![A log of events in the Notifications pane][NotificationsLog]  
    
1.  Click an event to view its details in the space below the table.

    > ![Viewing the details of an event in the Notifications pane][NotificationsDetails]  
    
<!--Todo: add open devtools section when available -->  

## Push Messages 

To display a push notification to a user, a **service worker** must first use the [Push Message API][MDNPush] to receive data from a server.  When the service worker is ready to display the notification, it uses the [Notifications API][MDNNotifications].  To log Push Messages for 3 days, even when DevTools is not open:  

1.  Open **DevTools**.  
1.  Open the **Application** panel.  
1.  Open the **Push Messaging** pane.  
    
    > ##### Figure 11  
    > The Push Messaging pane  
    > ![The Push Messaging pane][PushEmpty]  

1.  Click **Record** ![Record][ImageRecordIcon].  
    After triggering some Push Message activity, DevTools logs the events to the table.  
    
    > ##### Figure 12  
    > A log of events in the Push Messaging pane  
    > ![A log of events in the Push Messaging pane][PushLog]  

1.  Click an event to view its details in the space below the table.  
    
    > ##### Figure 13  
    > Viewing the details of an event in the Push Messaging pane  
    > ![Viewing the details of an event in the Push Messaging pane][PushDetails2]
