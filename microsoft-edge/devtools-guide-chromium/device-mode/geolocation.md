# Override Geolocation With Microsoft Edge DevTools   



Many websites take advantage of user location in order to provide a more relevant experience for the users.  For example, a weather website may show the local forecast in a user's area, after the user has granted the website permission to access the current user location.  

<!--todo: add link to user location section when available -->  

If you are building a UI that changes depending on where the user is located, you probably want to make sure that the site behaves correctly in different places around the world.  To override your geolocation in Microsoft Edge DevTools:  

1.  Press `Control`+`Shift`+`P` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` \(macOS\) to open the **Command Menu**.  
    
    > ##### Figure 1  
    > The Command Menu  
    > ![The Command Menu][ImageCommandMenu]  
    
1.  Type `sensors`, select **Show Sensors**, and press `Enter`.  The **Sensors** tab opens at the bottom of your DevTools window.  
1.  From the **Geolocation** list select one of the preset cities, like `Tokyo`, or select **Custom location** to enter custom longitude and latitude coordinates, or select **Location unavailable** to see how your site behaves when the user's location is not available.
