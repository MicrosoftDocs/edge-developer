# Simulate device orientation

Simulate different device orientations from Microsoft Edge DevTools.

<!--todo: update device orientation section when available -->

1.  Press `Control`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS) to open the **Command Menu**.

1.  Type `sensors`, choose **Show Sensors**, and select `Enter`.  The **Sensors** tool opens at the bottom of your DevTools window.

1.  From the **Orientation** list, select one of the preset orientations, such as `Portrait upside down`, or select **Custom orientation** to provide your own exact orientation.

If you select **Custom orientation**, the `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` rotational axis fields are enabled.
<!--To understand how each axis works, see [Device Orientation & Motion - Rotation data](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/device-orientation#rotation_data). -->
<!-- todo: link to a local copy of that article section when available; see "original page" below -->
You can also set a custom orientation by dragging the **Orientation Model**.  For example, to rotate along the `alpha` axis, hold `Shift` before dragging:
