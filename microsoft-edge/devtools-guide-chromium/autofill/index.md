# Autofill: Inspect and debug saved addresses
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/autofill -->

Use the **Autofill** tool to inspect and debug address info that's been saved to Microsoft Edge.

The **Autofill** tool records various events that the browser triggers when a user is filling in a form by using the browser's autofill feature -- for example, when the browser remembers your address and autofills it in an address field.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Overview

The **Autofill** tool provides a convenient way to automatically fill forms on websites with saved addresses.  The **Autofill** tool in DevTools lets you inspect the mapping between your form fields, predicted autofill values, and saved data.

The **Autofill** tool lets you inspect only the address info.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Save address info to Edge
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/autofill#save-to-chrome -->

By default, Microsoft Edge prompts you to save address info you entered into a web form when you submit it.

<!-- todo: find in Edge Settings -->

<!-- ![A prompt to save address info](todo: autofill-prompt.png) -->

<!-- If there's no such prompt, in Edge, select Customize and control > Password and Autofill > Addresses and more, and turn on Save and fill addresses. You can also add new addresses here. -->

<!-- ![The 'Addresses and more' menu option](todo: addresses-menu-option.png) -->

If you don't have address data saved and don't want to save it, you can use test address data provided by the **Autofill** tool.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open the **Autofill** tool

By default, the **Autofill** tool automatically opens if DevTools is open and when you autofill a form on a website.  To turn this off, open the panel manually and clear the **Automatically open this panel** checkbox.


To manually open the **Autofill** tool:

1. Open DevTools.

1. In the **Activity Bar** at top, select **More tools** > **Autofill**.


To open the **Autofill** tool from the **Command Menu**:

1. Open the **Command Menu** by pressing:

   * macOS: **Command+Shift+P**
   * Windows, Linux: **Control+Shift+P**

   <!-- ![Command Menu with "autofill" entered](todo: command-menu-autofill.png) -->

1. Start typing **autofill**, select **Show Autofill**, and the press **Enter**.

   By default, the **Autofill** tool opens in **Quick View** at the bottom of DevTools.  You can move it to the **Address Bar** at top.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Inspect autofill data
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/autofill#inspect -->

To inspect autofill data:

1. Make sure [Autofill is turned on and you have address info saved](#save-address-info-to-edge) in Microsoft Edge.  Alternatively, you can use test address data as described in the next section.

1. Open DevTools; for example, open [Demo page with accessibility issues](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-a11y-testing/) in a new window or tab, right-click the page, and then select **Inspect**.

1. In the address web form on the demo page, focus a form field.  Microsoft Edge shows a drop-down menu with autofill data options.
<!-- todo: no address form in https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos -->

1. Select an option from the menu.  Autofill fills the form with saved data and DevTools opens the **Autofill** tool if auto-open is turned on.  Otherwise, open the **Autofill** tool manually.

   <!-- ![An autofill data option selected](todo: autofill-data.png) -->


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Use test address data

If you don't have address data saved and don't want to save it, you can use test data that the **Autofill** tool provides.

To use the test data:

1. In DevTools, open the **Autofill** tool, and then turn on **Show test address data in autofill menu** at the top of the panel.

1. On the page, right-click an address form field, and then select one of the options from the **Developer tools** menu.

   <!-- ![The 'Developer tools' menu with test address data options](todo: test-address-data.png) -->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Data and its mapping
<!-- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/autofill#data -->

The **Autofill** tool shows the data it inserted in the form fields and a table with mapping between the following:

* **Form field** detected on the page.

* **Predicted autofill value**, which **Autofill** determines using heuristics.

* Value, if any, that **Autofill** inserted into fields it recognized.

   <!-- ![The Autofill tool](todo: autofill.panel.png) -->

Additionally, you can use the [Issues tool](../issues/index.md) to find problems with autocomplete attributes and get fixing tips.
