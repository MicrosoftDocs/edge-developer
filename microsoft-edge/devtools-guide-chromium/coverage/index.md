# Find unused JavaScript and CSS code with the Coverage tool

Shipping unused JavaScript or CSS is a common problem in web development for the following reasons:

*  The extra code slows down your page load.
*  If a user accesses the page on a mobile device, the extra code uses up their cellular data.

The **Coverage** tool can help you find unused JavaScript and CSS code.  Removing unused code can speed up your page load and save your mobile users cellular data.

Finding unused code is relatively easy.  But refactoring a codebase so that each page only ships the JavaScript and CSS that it needs can be difficult.  This guide doesn't cover how to refactor a codebase to avoid unused code, because this refactoring depends on your technology stack.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open the Coverage tool

1. [Open the Command Menu](../command-menu/index.md): press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS).

1. Start typing `coverage`, select the **Show Coverage** command, and then press `Enter`.  The **Coverage** tool opens.

You can also open the **Coverage** tool by click **More tools** (`+`) and selecting **Coverage** from the list.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Record code coverage

1. Navigate to the [TODO app](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/demo-to-do/) in a tab.

1. [Open the **Coverage** tool](#open-the-coverage-tool).

1. Click one of the following buttons in the **Coverage** tool:

   *  Click **Start Instrumenting Coverage And Reload Page** (![Start Instrumenting Coverage And Reload Page.](../media/reload-icon.msft.png))<!--todo: check UI string--> if you want to see what code is needed to load the page.

   *  Click **Instrument Coverage** (![Instrument Coverage](../media/record-icon.msft.png)) if you want to see what code is used after interacting with the page.

1. Interact with the page while instrumentation is being recorded. For example, add a few tasks in the TODO app.

1. Click **Stop Instrumenting Coverage And Show Results** (![Stop Instrumenting Coverage And Show Results](../media/stop-icon.msft.png)) when you want to stop recording code coverage.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Analyze code coverage

The table in the **Coverage** tool displays the resources that were analyzed, and how much code is used within each resource.

Columns in the code coverage report:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **URL** | The URL of the resource that was analyzed. |
| **Type** | Whether the resource contains CSS, JavaScript, or both. |
| **Total Bytes** | The total size of the resource in bytes. |
| **Unused Bytes** | The number of bytes that weren't used. |
| Last, unnamed column | A visualization of the **Total Bytes** and **Unused Bytes** columns.  The red section of the bar is unused bytes.  The green section is used bytes. |

Click a row to open the corresponding resource in the **Sources** tool and display a line-by-line breakdown of used code and unused code.

Lines that contain code that was used during the recording are highlighted in blue and unused lines are highlighted in red.
