# Find unused JavaScript and CSS code with the Coverage panel in Microsoft Edge DevTools  

The **Coverage** panel in Microsoft Edge DevTools helps you find unused JavaScript and CSS code.  Removing unused code may speed up your page load and save your mobile users cellular data.

   Analyzing code coverage  
:::image-end:::  

> [!WARNING]
> Finding unused code is relatively easy.  But refactoring a codebase so that each page only ships the JavaScript and CSS that it needs may be difficult.  This guide does not cover how to refactor a codebase to avoid unused code because these refactors depend highly on your technology stack.  

## Overview  

Shipping unused JavaScript or CSS is a common problem in web development.  For example, suppose that you want to use [Bootstrap button component][BootstrapButtons] on your page.  To use the button component you need to add a link to the Bootstrap stylesheet in your HTML, like this:  

```html
...
<head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">
    ...
</head>
...
```  

This stylesheet does not just include the code for the button component.  It contains the CSS for **all** of the Bootstrap components.  But you are not using any of the other Bootstrap components.  So your page is downloading a bunch of CSS that it does not need.  This extra CSS is a problem for the following reasons.  

*   The extra code slows down your page load.  <!--Navigate to [Render-Blocking CSS][render].  -->  
*   If a user accesses the page on a mobile device, the extra code uses up their cellular data.  
    
<!--[render]: /web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css  -->  

## Open the Coverage panel  

1.  [Open the Command Menu][DevToolsCommandMenu].  
1.  Start typing `coverage`, select the **Show Coverage** command, and then select `Enter` to run the command.  The **Coverage** panel opens in the **Drawer**.

## Record code coverage  

1.  Choose one of the following buttons in the **Coverage** panel.  
    *   Choose **Start Instrumenting Coverage And Reload Page** \(![Start Instrumenting Coverage And Reload Page](../media/reload-icon.msft.png)\) if you want to review what code is needed to load the page.  
    *   Choose **Instrument Coverage** \(![Instrument Coverage](../media/record-icon.msft.png)\) if you want to review what code is used after interacting with the page.  
1.  Choose **Stop Instrumenting Coverage And Show Results** \(![Stop Instrumenting Coverage And Show Results](../media/stop-icon.msft.png)\) when you want to stop recording code coverage.  
    
## Analyze code coverage  

The table in the **Coverage** panel displays the resources that were analyzed, and how much code is used within each resource.  Choose a row to open that resource in the **Sources** panel and review a line-by-line breakdown of used code and unused code.

:::image-end:::  

*   The **URL** column is the URL of the resource that was analyzed.  
*   The **Type** column says whether the resource contains CSS, JavaScript, or both.  
*   The **Total Bytes** column is the total size of the resource in bytes.  
*   The **Unused Bytes** column is the number of bytes that were not used.  
*   The last, unnamed column is a visualization of the **Total Bytes** and **Unused Bytes** columns.  The red section of the bar is unused bytes.  The green section is used bytes.
