# Sources Panel Overview 



Use the Microsoft Edge DevTools **Sources** panel to:

*   [View files](#view-files).  
*   [Edit CSS and JavaScript](#edit-css-and-javascript).  
*   [Create and save **Snippets** of JavaScript](#create-save-and-run-snippets), which you can run on any page.  **Snippets** are similar to bookmarklets.  
*   [Debug JavaScript](#debug-javascript).  
*   [Set up a Workspace](#set-up-a-workspace), so that changes you make in DevTools get saved to the code on
  your file system.  

## View files 

Use the **Page** pane to view all of the resources that the page has loaded.

<!--<figure>

> ![Figure 1. The Page pane][ImageSourcesPagePane]  

How the **Page** pane is organized:  
*   The top-level, such as `top` in [**Figure 1**](#figure-1), represents an [HTML frame][HTML4Frames].  You'll find `top` on every page that you visit. `top` represents the main document frame.  
*   The second-level, such as `docs.microsoft.com` in [**Figure 1**](#figure-1), represents an [origin][HTMLOrigin].  
*   The third-level, fourth-level, and so on, represent directories and resources that were loaded from that origin.  For example, in [**Figure 1**](#figure-1) the full path to the resource `devtools-guide-chromium` is `docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium`  

[HTML4Frames]: https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/frames.html  
[HTMLOrigin]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#origin  

Click a file in the **Page** pane to view its contents in the **Editor** pane.  You can view any type of file. For images, you see a preview of the image.

> ![Figure 2. Viewing the contents of 6fc26531.index-docs.js in the Editor pane][ImageSourcesEditorPane]  

## Edit CSS and JavaScript 

Use the **Editor** pane to edit CSS and JavaScript.  DevTools updates the page to run your new code. For example, if you edit the `text-subtle` of an element, you'll see that change take effect immediately.

<!--<figure>
  <img src="images/edit-css.msft.png"
       alt="Editing CSS in the Editor pane"/>

> ##### Figure 3  
> Editing CSS in the **Editor** pane to change the text color of the subtitle to red  
> ![Figure 3. Editing CSS in the Editor pane to change the text color of the subtitle to red][ImageEditCSS]  

CSS changes take effect immediately, no save needed. For JavaScript changes to take effect, press`Control`+`S` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`S` \(macOS\).  
DevTools doesn't re-run a script, so the only JavaScript changes that take effect are those that you make inside of functions.  <!--For example, in [**Figure 4**](#figure-4) note how `console.log('A')` doesn't run, whereas `console.log('B')` does. If DevTools re-ran the entire script after making the change, then the text `A` would have been logged to the **Console**. -->

</figure>-->

DevTools erases your CSS and JavaScript changes when you reload the page. See [Set up a Workspace](#set-up-a-workspace) to learn how to save the changes to your file system.  

## Create, save, and run Snippets 

Snippets are scripts which you can run on any page. Imagine that you repeatedly type out the following code in the **Console**, in order to insert the jQuery library into a page, so that you can run jQuery commands from the **Console**:  

```javascript
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js';
script.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
script.integrity = 'sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4=';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```  

Instead, you can save this code in a **Snippet** and run it with a couple of button clicks, any time you need it. DevTools saves the **Snippet** to your file system.  

<!--<figure>
  <img src="images/snippet.msft.png"
       alt="A Snippet that inserts the jQuery library into a page."/>
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 5</b>. A <b>Snippet</b> that inserts the jQuery library into a page
  </figcaption>
</figure>-->

> ##### Figure 5  
> A **Snippet** that inserts the jQuery library into a page  
> ![Figure 5. A Snippet that inserts the jQuery library into a page][ImageSnippet]  

To run a **Snippet**:

*   Open the file via the **Snippets** pane, and click **Run** ![The Run button][ImageRun].  
*   Open the **Command Menu**, delete the `>` character, type `!`, type the name of your **Snippet**, then press `Enter`.  

<!-- See [Run Snippets Of Code From Any Page][Snippet] to learn more.-->

<!--[Snippet]: /microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/snippets
[UICommandMenu]: /microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/ui#command-menu  -->

<!-- TODO: Link UI "Command Menu" when a good section exists. -->
<!-- TODO: Link "Snippets" when a good section exists. -->

## Debug JavaScript 

Rather than using `console.log()` to infer where your JavaScript is going wrong, consider using the Microsoft Edge DevTools debugging tools, instead. The general idea is to set a breakpoint, which is an intentional stopping place in your code, and then step through your code's execution, one line at a time. As you step through the code, you can view and change the values of all currently-defined properties and variables, run JavaScript in the **Console**, and more.

<!-- See [Get Started With Debugging JavaScript](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/javascript) to learn the
basics of debugging in DevTools.  -->

## Set up a Workspace 

By default, when you edit a file in the **Sources** panel, those changes are lost when you reload the page.  **Workspaces** enable you to save the changes that you make in DevTools to your file system.  Essentially, this lets you use DevTools as your code editor.

<!-- See [Edit Files With Workspaces][Workspaces] to get started.
