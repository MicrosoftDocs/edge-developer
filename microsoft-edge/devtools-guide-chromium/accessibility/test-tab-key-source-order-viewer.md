# Test keyboard support using the Source Order Viewer

The source order of a document is important for assistive technology, and can be different than the order in which elements appear on the rendered page.  Using CSS, you can re-order page elements in a visual way, but that doesn't mean that assistive technology such as screen readers would represent page elements in the same order as that CSS.  

To ensure that the document has a logical order, you can use the **Source Order Viewer** to label different page elements with numbers that specify the order in the source code of the document.  The **Source Order Viewer** is in the **Accessibility** tab (near the **Styles** tab).


## Analyzing the order of keyboard access through sections of the page

The accessibility-testing demo webpage has a counterintuitive tabbing order, where keyboard users access the sidebar navigation menu only after tabbing through all the **More** links.  The sidebar navigation menu is meant to be a shortcut to reach deep into the page content.  But because you need to go through the entire page before you reach the sidebar navigation menu, that navigation menu is ineffective for keyboard users.

The `Tab` key order on the demo page is:
1. The **Search** field, then the **go** button for the **Search** field.
1. The **More** button in the **Cats** section, to navigate to a "Cats" webpage.  Then the other **More** buttons, for Dogs, Sheep, Horses, and then Alpacas.
1. The blue links of the sidebar navigation menu: **Cats**, **Dogs**, **Sheep**, **Horses**, and then **Alpacas**.
1. The donation textbox in the donation form.
1. The buttons in the top navigation bar: **Home**, **Adopt a pet**, **Donate**, **Jobs**, and then **About Us**.
1. The browser's top-of-window interface.

The reason for the confusing `Tab` key order after the **More** buttons is that the order of keyboard access is determined by the source order of the document.  The order of keyboard access can also be modified by defining a `tabindex` attribute on any element, to take that element out of the source order.

In the source code of the document, the sidebar navigation menu with blue links appears _after_ the main content of the webpage.  The sidebar navigation menu is only rendered above most of the main content of the webpage because the sidebar navigation menu has been positioned using CSS.

You can test the order of page elements by using the **Source Order Viewer** in the **Accessibility** tab.  The **Source Order Viewer** is an experimental feature; for more information, see [Source Order Viewer](../experimental-features/index.md#source-order-viewer).


**To turn on the Source Order Viewer:**

1.  In DevTools, in the upper right, select the **Settings** \(![Settings button](../media/settings-button-icon.msft.png)\) button.  The **Settings** page of DevTools appears.

1.  Below **Settings**, select **Experiments**.  The **Experiments** settings page appears.

1.  Select the **Source Order Viewer** checkbox.

1.  In the upper-right corner of the **Settings** page, select **X** to close the Settings page.  At the top of DevTools, a message appears: "One or more settings have changed which require a reload to take effect."

1.  Select the **Reload DevTools** button.


**To activate and use the Source Order Viewer, with the demo page:**

1.  Open the [accessibility-testing demo webpage][DevToolsA11yErrorsDemopage] in a new tab.  Then select **F12** to open DevTools.

1.  In the **Elements** tool, to the right of the **Styles** tab, select the **Accessibility** tab.

1.  In the **Source Order Viewer** section, select the **Show source order** checkbox.  In the rendered webpage, numbers appear, indicating the `Tab` order as controlled by the order of lines of code in the source file.

1.  In the DOM tree in the **Elements** tool, select a major layout element, such as the `header` element.  Numeric overlays now appear on sections of the rendered page, showing you the source order without you having to manually check the order in the HTML file:

    :::image type="complex" source="../media/a11y-testing-source-order-viewer.msft.png" alt-text="Activating the Source Order Viewer shows the order of the elements in the source as overlays on the page" lightbox="../media/a11y-testing-source-order-viewer.msft.png":::
        Activating the **Source Order Viewer** shows the order of the elements in the source as overlays on the page
    :::image-end:::
    
1.  Scroll the page to see all of the numeric overlays, including on the page footer section.
