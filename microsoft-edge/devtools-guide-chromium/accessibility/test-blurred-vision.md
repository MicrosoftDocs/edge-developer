# Verify that the page is usable with blurred vision

<!-- Rendering tool: Emulate vision deficiencies: Blurred vision -->

To simulate blurred vision, in the **Rendering** tool, use the **Emulate vision deficiencies** menu.  When you use this feature with the demo webpage, you can see that the drop shadow on the text in the upper menu makes it hard to read the menu items.

**To check whether a webpage is usable with blurred vision:**

1.  Open the [accessibility-testing demo webpage][DevToolsA11yErrorsDemopage] in a new tab of the browser, and then select **F12** to open DevTools.

1.  Select **Esc** to open the Drawer at the bottom of DevTools.  Select the **+** icon at the top of the Drawer to see the list of tools, and then select **Rendering**.  The Rendering tool appears.

1.  In the **Emulate vision deficiencies** dropdown list, select **Blurred vision**.

    :::image-end:::

    Now you can see that the `text-shadow` CSS property on the text in the upper menu (**Home**, **Adopt a Pet**...) makes it hard to read the menu items.
    
1.  In the **Rendering** tool, below **Emulate vision deficiencies**, select **No emulation**.
