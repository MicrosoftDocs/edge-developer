# Test accessibility using Lighthouse

You can use Lighthouse from within DevTools to audit the accessibility of a page and generate a report. You can use the Lighthouse tool to determine:

*  Whether a page is properly marked up for screen readers.

*  Whether the text elements on a page have sufficient contrast ratios using the Color Picker. See [Test text-color contrast using the Color Picker](color-picker.md).

The **Lighthouse** tool provides links to content hosted on third-party websites.  Microsoft is not responsible for and has no control over the content of these sites and any data that may be collected.

To audit a page using the Lighthouse tool:

1. Go to the URL that you want to audit.

1. In DevTools, select the **Lighthouse** tool.  Configuration options are displayed:

   ![Lighthouse configuration options](../media/accessibility-lighthouse.msft.png)

1. For **Device**, select **Mobile** if you want to simulate a mobile device.  This option changes your user agent string and resizes the viewport.  This option can affect the audit results.

1. In the **Categories** section, select **Accessibility**.

1. Click **Generate report**. After 10 to 30 seconds, DevTools displays a report.  The report gives tips on how to improve the accessibility of the page:

   ![A Lighthouse report for the Accessibility category](../media/accessibility-lighthouse-result.msft.png)

1. Select an item in the report to learn more about it.

   ![An expanded issue in a Lighthouse report](../media/accessibility-lighthouse-result-issue-expanded.msft.png)

1. Click the **Learn more** link to view the documentation of the issue:

   ![View the documentation of an issue](../media/accessibility-web-dev-accessibility-audits-learn-more.msft.png)

1. To return to the configuration options, in DevTools, click **Perform an audit** (`+`).
