# Reduced motion simulation  

Animation in web products may be an accessibility problem.  Operating systems deal with this problem by including an option to turn off animations to avoid user confusion and potential health-related problems, such as triggering seizures.  

On a webpage, you can use the [prefers-reduced-motion][MDNPrefersReducedMotion] CSS media query to detect whether the user prefers to display any animations.  Then wrap your animation code in a test, to conditionally run animations.  

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* in case the .header element has an animation, turn it off */
  .header {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```  

Then test your code, as follows.

**To simulate the operating system's reduced motion setting, without having to change your operating system setting:**

1.  Open the **Command Menu**.  
    1.  Select `Control`+`Shift`+`P` on Windows/Linux or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` on macOS.  
        
        :::image type="complex" source="../media/css-console-command-menu-rendering.msft.png" alt-text="The Command Menu" lightbox="../media/css-console-command-menu-rendering.msft.png":::
           The **Command Menu**  
        :::image-end:::  
        
1.  Type `reduced`, to turn the simulation on and off.  Choose the option and select `Enter`.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="../media/css-elements-styles-qs-select-reduced-motion-command-menu.msft.png" alt-text="Turn on or off the prefers reduced motion setting from Command Menu" lightbox="../media/css-elements-styles-qs-select-reduced-motion-command-menu.msft.png":::
       Turn on or off the **prefers reduced motion** setting from **Command Menu**  
    :::image-end:::  
    
1.  Refresh the webpage and check whether your animations run.
