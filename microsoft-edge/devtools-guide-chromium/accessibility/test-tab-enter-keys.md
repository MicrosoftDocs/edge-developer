# Check for keyboard support by using the Tab and Enter keys

Test the usability of a webpage for keyboard users in several ways:
*  By using the keyboard, particularly the `Tab`, `Shift`+`Tab`, and `Enter` keys.  This approach is described in the current article.
*  Check for keyboard support for an individual element by using the **Inspect** tool.  The Inspect tool's information overlay includes an **Accessibility** section that includes a **Keyboard-focusable** row.  
*  Check the **Issues** report's **Accessibility** section for keyboard support issues.

Not all users have a pointer or touch device, and not all users can see the web projects we create.  This is why it is important that the user interface works at least with a keyboard.  Make sure you can use the `Tab` key to move the focus to each form control on a webpage, and make sure you can use the `Enter` key to submit the form.

**To check the demo page for accessibility issues by using a keyboard rather than a mouse:**

1.  Open the [accessibility-testing demo webpage][DevToolsA11yErrorsDemopage] in a new tab of the browser.

1.  Use a keyboard to navigate the demo document, using the `Tab` and `Shift`+`Tab` keys to jump from element to element.  On the demo webpage, the `Tab` key first moves focus to the search form in the `header` section.

1.  Select `Tab` to put focus on a button, and then select `Enter` to click the focused button.  For example, in the demo page, select `Tab` to put focus on the **Search** field, and then select `Enter` to submit the search.

    This approach produces the same result as clicking the **go** button.  Selecting `Enter` to send the **Search** form works correctly, despite the `label` element issue that's found by the **Issues tool**.

1.  Select `Tab` again.  The next element you put focus on is the first **More** link in the `content` section of the webpage, as indicated by an outline.

1.  Select `Tab` several more times until you go past the last **More** link.  The page scrolls up again and you seem to be on some element of the page, but you don't know which element.

1.  Notice the URL in the bottom left.  If you look to the bottom left of the screen (or if you use a screen reader), you realize that you are on the sidebar navigation menu with blue links, because the browser shows the URL that the **Cats** link points to (`#cats`).

The only hint is the display of the link target in the bottom left corner of the screen" lightbox="../media/a11y-testing-lack-of-focus-style.msft.png":::

1.  Select `Tab` again, to get to the entry field in the donation form.  However, you can't reach the buttons above the textbox by selecting `Tab`; you can't use the keyboard to put focus on the **50**, **100**, or **200** buttons and then to click them.  Also, selecting `Enter` doesn't submit the donation form.

        The only keyboard-accessible element in the donation form is the text entry field
    :::image-end:::
    
1.  Selecting `Tab` again puts focus on the top navigation bar of the page, with menu buttons for **Home**, **Adopt a Pet**, **Donate**, **Jobs**, and **About Us**.  Select `Tab` or `Shift`+`Tab` to put focus on a menu button, as indicated by a focus outline.  Then select `Enter` to access that section of the webpage.

    :::image type="complex" source="../media/a11y-testing-menu-with-outline.msft.png" alt-text="The main menu has a highlight and a focus outline, and thus is keyboard-accessible" lightbox="../media/a11y-testing-menu-with-outline.msft.png":::

We found some issues here to fix:

*  When using a keyboard, the blue links of the sidebar navigation menu don't visually indicate which link has focus.  This issue is covered in [Analyze the lack of indication of keyboard focus in a sidebar menu](test-analyze-no-focus-indicator.md).

*  In the donation form, the amount buttons and the **Donate** button don't work with a keyboard.  This issue is covered in [Analyze the lack of keyboard support in a form](test-analyze-no-keyboard-support.md).

*  The order of the keyboard access through sections of the page seems wrong.  You navigate through all the **More** links in the document before you reach the sidebar navigation menu.  This makes the sidebar navigation menu pointless.  By the time the `Tab` key puts focus on the sidebar navigation menu, you already traversed all the content that the sidebar navigation menu was supposed to provide easy access to.  This issue is analyzed in [Test keyboard support using the Source Order Viewer](test-tab-key-source-order-viewer.md).
