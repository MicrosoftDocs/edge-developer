# Test accessibility using the Accessibility tab

The **Accessibility** tab is where you view the accessibility tree, ARIA attributes, and computed accessibility properties of DOM nodes.

To open the **Accessibility** tab:

1.  Select the **Elements** tool.
1.  In the **DOM Tree**, select the element which you want to inspect.
1.  Select the **Accessibility** tab.  You might need to first select the **More tabs** (![the More tabs button](../media/more-tabs-icon.msft.png)) button to the right of the **Styles** tab.

## View the position of an element in the Accessibility Tree

The [accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/AOM) is a subset of the DOM tree.  The accessibility tree only contains elements from the DOM tree that are relevant and useful for displaying the contents of a page through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Inspect the position of an element in the accessibility tree from the **Accessibility** tab.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## View the ARIA attributes of an element

ARIA attributes ensure that assistive technologies such as screen readers have all of the information that they need in order to properly represent the contents of a page.

View the ARIA attributes of an element in the **Accessibility** tab.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## View the computed accessibility properties of an element

Some accessibility properties are dynamically calculated by the browser.  These properties are displayed in the **Computed Properties** section of the **Accessibility** tab.

View the computed accessibility properties of an element in the **Accessibility** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> For computed CSS properties, use the [Computed](../css/reference.md#view-only-the-css-that-is-actually-applied-to-an-element) tab.
