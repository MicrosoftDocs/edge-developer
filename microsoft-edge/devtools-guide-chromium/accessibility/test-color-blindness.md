# Verify that a page is usable by people with color blindness

<!-- Rendering tool: Emulate vision deficiencies: Protanopia -->

To check that a webpage is usable by people with color blindness, in the **Rendering** tool, use the **Emulate vision deficiencies** dropdown list.

On the accessibility-testing demo webpage, the different donation states use color as the only means of differentiation:
*  Green means a high amount of donations have been received.
*  Yellow means a medium amount of donations have been received.
*  Red means a low amount of donations have been received.

But you can't expect all of your users to experience these colors as intended.  By using the **Emulate vision deficiencies** feature of the **Rendering** tool, you can find out that this design isn't good enough, by simulating how people with different vision would perceive your design.


To check whether a webpage is usable by people with color blindness:

1. Open the [accessibility-testing demo webpage](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-a11y-testing/) in a new window or tab.

1. Right-click anywhere in the webpage and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press `F12`.  DevTools opens next to the webpage.

1. Press **Esc** to open the Drawer at the bottom of DevTools.  Click the **+** icon at the top of the Drawer to see the list of tools, and then select **Rendering**.

1. In the **Emulate vision deficiencies** dropdown list, select **Protanopia**.  _Protanopia_ is reduced sensitivity to red light, making it hard to differentiate green, red, and yellow.

1. In the **Rendering** tool, below **Emulate vision deficiencies**, select **No emulation** to remove the simulation.
