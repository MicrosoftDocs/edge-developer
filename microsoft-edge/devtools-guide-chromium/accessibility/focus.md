# Track which element has focus

Suppose that you are testing the keyboard navigation accessibility of a page.  When navigating the page with the `Tab` key, the focus ring sometimes disappears because the element that has focus is hidden.

To track the focused element in DevTools:

1.  Open the **Console**.
1.  Choose **Create live expression** (![Create live expression](../media/create-live-expression-icon.msft.png)).

    :::image type="complex" source="../media/accessibility-console-create-live-expression-empty.msft.png" alt-text="Create a Live Expression" lightbox="../media/accessibility-console-create-live-expression-empty.msft.png":::
       Create a Live Expression
    :::image-end:::

1.  Type `document.activeElement`.
1.  To save the expression, select outside of the live expression.

The value displayed below `document.activeElement` is the result of the expression.

Since that expression always represents the focused element, you now have a way to always keep track of which element has focus.

*   Hover on the result to highlight the focused element in the viewport.
*   Hover on the result, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Reveal in Elements panel** to show the element in the DOM Tree on the **Elements** tool.
*   Hover on the result, open the contextual menu (right-click), and choose **Store as global variable** to create a variable reference to the node that you are able to use in the **Console**.
