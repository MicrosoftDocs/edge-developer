# Track Which Element Has Focus   



Suppose that you are testing the keyboard navigation accessibility of a page.  When navigating the page with the `Tab` key, the focus ring sometimes disappears because the element that has focus is hidden.  To track the focused element in DevTools:  

1.  Open the **Console**.  
1.  Click **Create Live Expression** ![Create Live Expression][ImageCreateIcon].  

    > ##### Figure 1  
    > Creating a **Live Expression**  
    > ![Creating a Live Expression][ImageLiveExpression]  
    
1.  Type `document.activeElement`.
1.  Click outside of the **Live Expression** UI to save.

The value that you see below `document.activeElement` is the result of the expression.  
Since that expression always represents the focused element, you now have a way to always keep track of which element has focus.  

*   Hover over the result to highlight the focused element in the viewport.  
*   Right-click the result and select **Reveal in Elements panel** to show the element in the DOM Tree on the **Elements** panel.  
*   Right-click the result and select **Store as global variable** to create a variable reference to the node that you are able to use in the **Console**.
