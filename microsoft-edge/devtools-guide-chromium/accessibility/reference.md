## Further automated and manual testing

Testing the accessibility of your website is important to ensure that people with different needs can use your website.  The DevTools features described above are a good start to catch accessibility problems in your products.  These features range from automated checks and manual detail checks to simulation of different states and environments.


#### First, use DevTools automated reports and manual testing

As covered in the tables above, DevTools includes automated accessibility-testing features, such as tools that automatically generate accessibility reports for a webpage, including the **Issues** tool and the **Lighthouse** tool.  You can also use the Assessments feature of Accessibility Insights, per below.

Microsoft Edge, including DevTools, also supports manual accessibility testing, such as: 
* Inspect different parts of the page by using the **Inspect** tool.
* Use the keyboard to navigate the page.
* Look for issues that arise when interacting with the page.
* Look for issues related to changes in display, such as making the window narrow.


#### Perform additional checks

After the tests that are listed above, you may need to perform additional checks, such as:

* Testing when zoomed-in.
* Testing with screen readers.
* Testing with voice recognition.
* Testing in high-contrast mode.


#### Use testers who have different accessibility needs

Ideally, have testers with different accessibility needs use these automated testing features and do manual accessibility testing.

Automated tools can't find all the problems in a product, because many of the accessibility barriers show up only during interactive use.  None of these features can replace a proper round of testing with people that use assistive technologies and following a plan to check for all the required tests.


#### Use Accessibility Insights

You can also use the [Assessments](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/getstarted/assessment/) feature of [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io).


#### Use webhint in Visual Studio Code

Another way to find out what to do to improve your webpage is to use the [webhint extension for Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/webhint4code).  This extension flags the readily detectable accessibility problems in your source code and gives insights on how to fix them.
