# Analyze the lack of keyboard support in a form

This article uses the **Inspect** tool and **Event Listeners** tab to analyze the lack of keyboard support in a demo page which has buttons that use the `div` element.

In the **Donate** form within the accessibility-testing demo webpage, the amount buttons and the **Donate** button don't work with a keyboard.  Debugging the donation form requires understanding why the lack of focus styling doesn't get flagged as a problem by automatic testing, such as the **Issues** tool: the buttons are implemented using the `div` element, which is not recognized by tools as a control on a form.

**To use the Inspect tool and Event Listeners tab to analyze the lack of keyboard support in the demo page:**

<!-- 1. Inspect tool: Accessibility section: keyboard-focusable row -->

1.  Open the [accessibility-testing demo webpage][DevToolsA11yErrorsDemopage] in a new tab of the browser, and then select **F12** to open DevTools.
    
1.  Select the **Inspect** \(![Inspect icon](../media/inspect-icon.msft.png)\) button in the top-left corner of DevTools so that the button is highlighted (blue).

1.  Hover over the **50**, **100**, and **200** donation buttons.  The Inspect tool appears on the webpage, as an overlay.  The **keyboard-focusable** row of the Inspect overlay shows that none of the donation amount buttons are keyboard-accessible, as indicated by a gray circle with diagonal line.  The buttons have no name, and they have a role of `generic` (because they are `div` elements), which means that the buttons aren't accessible to assistive technology.

1.  When the **Inspect** tool is active, on the webpage, select the **Other** input textbox, above the **Donate** button.  The **Elements** tool opens, showing the DOM tree for the webpage.  The element `<input id="freedonation" class="smallinput">` is selected.

    ```html
    <div class="donationrow">
        <div class="donationbutton">50</div>
        <div class="donationbutton">100</div>
        <div class="donationbutton">200</div>
    </div>
    <div class="donationrow">
        <label for="freedonation">Other</label>
        <input id="freedonation" class="smallinput">
    </div>
    <div class="donationrow">
        <div class="submitbutton">Donate</div>
    </div>
    ```

    The use of the `label` and `input` elements for the **Other** textbox is valid, so that the **Other** label is correctly linked with the input textbox.  The `input` textbox is also keyboard-accessible.  The rest of the form's markup are `div` elements, which are easy to style, but have no semantic meaning.

    <!-- 2. Elements tool: Event Listeners tab -->

    The form's functionality is created with JavaScript, and you can test this by checking the **Event Listeners** tab, as follows.

1.  With the element `<input id="freedonation" class="smallinput">` still selected in the DOM tree, select the **Event Listeners** tab to the right of the **Styles** tab, and then expand the `click` event listener.

1.  Select the `buttons.js:18` link.  The **Sources** tool opens, showing the applied JavaScript:

    :::image-end:::

```javascript
donations.addEventListener('click', e => {
  let t = e.target;
  if (t.classList.contains('donationbutton')) {
    if (currentbutton) { currentbutton.classList.remove('current'); }
    t.classList.add('current');
    currentbutton = t;
    e.preventDefault();
  }
  if (t.classList.contains('submitbutton')) {
    alert('Thanks for your donation!')
  } 
})
```

Using a `click` event to read the buttons is good practice, because a `click` event fires both on mouse pointer and keyboard interaction.  However, because a `div` element isn't keyboard-accessible, and this **Donate** button is implemented as a `div` element (`<div class="submitbutton">Donate</div>`), this JavaScript functionality never executes unless you use a mouse or an equivalent source of a `click` event, such as a specialized button on some keyboards.

This is a classic example where some extra JavaScript was necessary to create functionality that `button` elements would have provided natively, and simulating the functionality of buttons ended up producing an inaccessible experience.
