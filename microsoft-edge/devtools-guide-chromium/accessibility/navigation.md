# Navigate Microsoft Edge DevTools with assistive technology  

The following article aims to help users who primarily rely on assistive technology like screen readers access and use [Microsoft Edge DevTools][MicrosoftEdgeDevtoolsMain].  [Microsoft Edge DevTools][MicrosoftEdgeDevtoolsMain] is a suite of web developer tools built into the Microsoft Edge browser.  If you are looking for DevTools features related to improving the accessibility of a web page,  see [Accessibility Reference][DevtoolsAccessibilityReference].  

The accessibility of DevTools is a work-in-progress.  Some panels and tabs work better with assistive technology than others.  This guide walks you through the panels which are the most accessible and highlights specific issues you may encounter along the way.  

## Overview  

Before starting, it helps to have a mental model of how the DevTools UI is structured.  DevTools is divided into a series of panels which are organized into an [ARIA tablist][W3CWaiAriaTablist].  

For example:  

*   The **Elements** panel lets you [view and change DOM nodes][DevtoolsDomIndexNavigateDomTreeKeyboard] or [CSS][DevtoolsCssIndex].  
*   The [Console panel][DevtoolsConsoleIndex] lets you read JavaScript logs and live edit objects.  

Within the content area of each panel, there are a number of different tools, often referred to as tabs or panes in the documentation.  
For instance, the **Elements** panel contains additional tabs to inspect event listeners, the accessibility tree, and much more.  The distinction between tabs and panes is somewhat arbitrary.  The only reason you may see one term or the other is to maintain consistency with the rest of the official DevTools documentation.  

## Keyboard shortcuts  

The [DevTools Keyboard Shortcuts reference][DevtoolsShortcuts] is a helpful cheatsheet.  Be sure to bookmark it and refer back to it as you explore the different panels.  

## Open DevTools  

To get started, see [Open Microsoft Edge DevTools][DevtoolsOpen].  There are a number of ways to open DevTools, either through keyboard shortcuts or menu items.  

## Navigate between panels  

### Navigate by keyboard  

*   With DevTools open, select `Control`+`]` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`]` \(macOS\) to focus the next panel.  
*   Select `Control`+`[` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`[` \(macOS\) to focus the previous panel.  
*   It is also possible to use `Shift`+`Tab` to move focus into the [ARIA tablist][W3CWaiAriaTablist] of a panel and use the arrow keys to change panels, though it may be faster to use the previously mentioned shortcuts.  

**Known issues**  

*   Some panels, such as the **Console** and **Performance** panels, may move focus into the panel content area as soon as each panel is activated.  This may make navigating by arrow keys difficult.  
*   The name of the selected panel is announced, but only after it has read the focused content in the panel.  This may make it very easy to miss.  

### Navigate by Command Menu  

To focus a specific panel, use the [Command Menu][DevtoolsCommandMenuIndex]:  

1.  With DevTools open, select `Control`+`Shift`+`P` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` \(macOS\) to open the **Command Menu**.  
    The **Command Menu** is a fuzzy search autocomplete combobox.  
1.  Type the name of the panel you want to open, then use the `Down Arrow` on the keyboard to navigate to the correct option.  
1.  Select `Enter` to run a command.  

Complete the following actions to open the **Elements** panel.  

1.  Open the **Command Menu**.  
1.  Type `E` then `L`.  The **Panel > Show Elements** option is selected.  
1.  Select `Enter` to run the command that opens the panel.  

Open a panel this way directs focus to the contents of the panel.  In the case of the **Elements** panel, focus moves into the **DOM Tree**.  

## Elements panel  

### Inspect an element on the page  

1.  Navigate to the element you want to inspect using the cursor in the screen reader.  
1.  Simulate a right-click using a mouse on the element to open the context menu.  
1.  Choose the **Inspect** option.  This [opens the Elements panel and focuses the element in the DOM Tree][DevtoolsDomIndexViewDomNodes].  

The **DOM Tree** is laid out as an [ARIA tree][W3CWaiAriaTree].  For an example, see [Navigate the **DOM Tree** with a keyboard][DevtoolsDomIndexNavigateDomTreeKeyboard].  

### Copy the code for an element in the DOM Tree  

1.  With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, hover on the node and open the contextual menu \(right-click\).  
1.  Expand the **Copy** option.  
1.  Select **Copy outerHTML**.  

**Known issues**  

*   **Copy outerHTML** often does not select the current node but instead selects the parent node.  However, the contents of the element should still be in the copied outerHTML.  

### Modify the attributes of an element in the DOM Tree  

*   With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, select `Enter` to make it editable.  
*   Select `Tab` to move between attribute values.  When you hear "space" you are inside of an empty text input and are able to type a new attribute value.  
*   Select `Control`+`Enter` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`Enter` \(macOS\) to accept the change and hear the entire contents of the element.  

**Known issues**  

*   When you type into the text input you get no feedback.  If you make a typo and use the arrow keys to explore your input you also get no feedback.  The easiest way to check your work is to accept the change, then listen for the entire element to be announced.  

### Edit the HTML of an element in the DOM Tree  

*   With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, select `Enter` to make it editable.  
*   Select `Tab` to move between attribute values.  When you hear the name of the element, for instance, `h2`, you are inside of a text input and may change the type of the element.  
*   Select `Control`+`Enter` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`Enter` \(macOS\) to accept the change.  

For example, when you type `h3` and select `Control`+`Enter` \(Windows\) or `Command`+`Enter` \(macOS\), the start and end tags of the `h3` element change.  

## Elements panel tabs  

The **Elements** panel contains additional tabs for inspecting things like the CSS applied to an element or the relevant place in the accessibility tree.  

*   With focus on a node in the **DOM Tree**, select `Tab` until you hear that the **Styles** pane is selected.  
*   Use the `Right Arrow` to explore other available tabs.  

The **DOM Tree** turns elements with `href` attributes into focusable links, so you may need to select `Tab` more than once to reach the **Styles** pane.  

**Known issues**  

The **DOM Breakpoints** and **Properties** tabs are not keyboard accessible.  

### Styles pane  

In the **Styles** pane find controls for filtering styles, toggling element states \(such as [:active][MDNActive] and [:focus][MDNFocus]\), toggling classes, and adding new classes.  There is also a powerful style inspection tool to explore and modify styles currently applied to the element that is in focus in the **DOM Tree**.  

The key concept to understand about the **Styles** pane is that it only shows styles for the currently-selected node in the **DOM Tree**.  For example, suppose you are done inspecting the styles of a `<header>` node, and now you want to look at the styles for a `<footer>` node.  To do that, you first need to select the `<footer>` node in the **DOM Tree**.  You may find it faster to use the [Inspect](#inspect-an-element-on-the-page) workflow to inspect a node that is in the general vicinity of the `footer` node \(such as a link within the footer\), which focuses the **DOM Tree**, and then use your keyboard to navigate to the exact node in which you are interested.  

#### Navigate the Styles pane  

Because all of the style tools connect in one way or another back to the **Styles** pane, it makes sense to become an expert in this tool first.  

*   With focus on the **Styles** pane, select `Tab` to move focus inside and explore the contents.  
*   Select `Tab` until the first style becomes active.  If you are using a screen reader this first style is
  announced as `element.style {}`.  
*   Select `Down Arrow` to navigate the list of styles in order of specificity.  A screen reader announces each style starting with the name of the CSS file, the line number on which the style appears, and the name of the style.  For example, `main.css:233 .card__img {}`.  
*   Select `Enter` to inspect a style in more detail.  Focus begins on an editable version of the style name.  
*   Select `Tab` to move between editable versions of each CSS property and the corresponding values.  At the end of each style block is a blank editable text field which you may use to add additional CSS properties.  
*   You may continue to select `Tab` to move through the list of styles, or select `Escape` to exit the mode and go back to navigating by arrow keys.  

For additional shortcuts, see [Styles pane keyboard reference][DevtoolsShortcutsStylesPaneKeyboard].  

**Known issues**  

*   If you use the **Filter** editable text field, you are no longer be able to navigate the list of styles.  

#### Toggle element state  

To toggle the state of an element, such as `:active` or `:focus`:  

1.  Navigate to the **Styles** pane and select `Tab` until the **Toggle Element State** button has focus.  
1.  Select `Enter` to expand the collection of element states.  The element states are presented as a group of checkboxes.  
1.  Select `Tab` until the first state, `:active`, has focus.  
1.  Select `Space` to enable it.  If the currently-selected element in the DOM Tree has an `:active` style, it is now applied.  
1.  Hold `Tab` to explore all of the available states.  

#### Add an existing class  

Adjacent to the **Toggle Element State** button is the **Element Classes** button.  To move the focus to it, select `Tab` and select `Enter`.  Focus moves into an edit text field labeled **Add New Class**.  

The **Element Classes** button is primarily used for adding existing classes to an element.  For example, if your stylesheet contained a helper class named `.clearfix` you may select `.` inside of the edit text field to see a suggestion list of classes and use the `Down Arrow` to find the `.clearfix` suggestion.  Or type the class name out yourself and select `Enter` to apply it.  

#### Add a new style rule  

Adjacent to the **Element Classes** button is the **New Style Rule** button.  To move the focus to it, select `Tab` and select `Enter`.  Focus moves into an editable text field inside of the style inspector.  The initial text content of the field is the tag name of the element that is selected in the **DOM Tree**.  
You may type any class name you want into this field and then select `Tab` to assign CSS properties to it.  

### Computed tab  

With focus on the **Computed** tab, select `Tab` to move focus inside and explore the contents.  Within the **Computed** tab there are controls for exploring which CSS properties are actually applied to an element in order of specificity.  

<!--todo: add computed tab section when available  -->  

#### Explore all computed styles  

Select `Tab` until you reach the collection of computed styles.  These are presented as an [ARIA tree][W3CWaiAriaTree].  Expanding a listbox reveals which CSS selectors are applying the computed style.  These selectors are organized by specificity.  A screen reader announces the computed value, which CSS selector is currently matching, the filename of the stylesheet that contains the selector, and the line number for the selector.  

**Known issues**  

*   If you use the **Filter** text field, you are no longer able to inspect styles.  

### Event listeners tab  

From within the **Elements** panel you may inspect the event listeners applied to an element using the **Event Listeners** tab.  With focus on the **Styles** pane, select the `Right Arrow` to navigate to the **Event Listeners** tab.  

#### Explore event listeners  

Event listeners are presented as an [ARIA tree][W3CWaiAriaTree].  You may use the arrow keys to navigate them.  A screen reader announces the name of the DOM object that the event listener is attached to, as well as the file name where the event listener is defined and the line number.  

### Accessibility pane  

With focus on the **Accessibility** pane, select `Tab` to move focus inside and explore the contents.  On the [Accessibility pane][DevtoolsAccessibilityReference] there are controls for exploring the accessibility tree, the ARIA attributes applied to an element, and the computed accessibility properties.  

#### Accessibility Tree  

The **Accessibility Tree** is presented as an [ARIA tree][W3CWaiAriaTree] where each `treeitem` corresponds to an element in the DOM.  The tree announces the computed role for the selected node.  Generic elements like `div` and `span` are announced as "GenericContainer" in the tree.  Use the arrow keys to traverse the tree and explore parent-child relationships.  

**Known issues**  

*   The type of [ARIA tree][W3CWaiAriaTree] used by the **Accessibility** pane may not be properly exposed in Microsoft Edge for macOS screen readers like VoiceOver.  Subscribe to [Chromium issue #868480][ChromiumIssues868480]
  to be informed about progress on this issue.  
*   Each of the **ARIA Attributes** and **Computed Properties** sections are marked up as an [ARIA tree][W3CWaiAriaTree], but each does not currently have focus management and is not keyboard operable.  

## Audits panel  

The **Audits** panel you should run a series of tests against a site to check for common issues related to performance, accessibility, SEO, and a number of other categories.  

### Configure and run an audit  

1.  When the **Audits** panel is first opened, focus is placed on the **Run Audit** button at the end of the form.  By default the form is configured to run audits for every category using mobile emulation on a simulated 3G connection.  
1.  Use `Shift`+`Tab` or navigate back in Browse mode to change the audit settings.  
1.  When you are ready to run the audit, navigate back to the **Run Audit** button and select `Enter`.  
1.  Focus moves into a modal window with a **Cancel** button which allows you to exit the audit.  You may hear a series of earcons as the audit runs and refreshes the page multiple times.  

**Known issues**  

*   The different sections of the configuration form are not currently marked up with a `fieldset` element.  It may be easier to navigate them in Browse mode to figure out which controls are associated with each section.  
*   There is no earcon or live region announcement when the audit is finished running.  Generally it takes about 30 seconds, after which you should be able to navigate to the results.  Using Browse mode may be the easiest way to reach the results.  

### Navigate the audit report  

The audit report is organized into sections that correspond with each of the audit categories.  The report opens with a list of scores for each category.  These scores are also links which are able to be used to skip to the relevant sections.  Within each section are expandable `details` elements, which contain information relating to passed or failed audits.  By default, only failing audits are shown.  Each section ends with a final `details` element which contains all of the passed audits.  

To run a new audit, use `Shift`+`Tab` to exit the report and look for the **Perform An Audit** button.
