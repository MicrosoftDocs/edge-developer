# Run JavaScript in the Console

The **Console** tool inside the browser DevTools is a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) environment.  REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. The **Console** reads the JavaScript that you type into it, evaluates your code, prints out the result of your expression, and then loops back to the first step.  This means that you can write any JavaScript in the **Console** that runs immediately.

To try it:

1.  Open the **Console**.  For example, press `Control`+`Shift`+`J` \(Windows, Linux\) or `Command`+`Option`+`J` \(macOS\).

1.  Type `2 + 2`.

    The **Console** immediately displays the result `4` on the next line while you type.  The `Eager evaluation` feature helps you write valid JavaScript.  It displays the result while you type, regardless of whether your JavaScript is correct, and regardless of whether a valid result exists.

If you press `Enter`, the **Console** runs the JavaScript command, gives you the result, and allows you to write the next command.

## Autocompletion to write complex expressions

The **Console** helps you write complex JavaScript using autocompletion.  This feature is a great way to learn about methods you didn't know before.

To try it:

1.  Type `doc`.
1.  Press the arrow keys to highlight `document` on the dropdown menu.
1.  Press the `Tab` key to select `document`.
1.  Type `.bo`.
1.  Press `Tab` to enter `document.body`.
1.  Type another `.` to get a large list of possible properties and methods available on the body of the current webpage.

## Console history

As with many other command-line experiences, you also have a history of commands.  Press `Up Arrow` to display the commands you entered before.  Autocompletion also keeps a history of the commands you previously typed.  You can type the first few letters of earlier commands and your previous choices display in a textbox.

Also, the **Console** also offers quite a few [utility methods](utilities.md) that make your life easier.  For example, `$_` always contains the result of the last expression you ran in the **Console**.

    The `$_` expression in the **Console** always contains the last result
:::image-end:::

## Multiline edits

By default, the **Console** only gives you one line to write your JavaScript expression.  You code runs when you press `Enter`. The one line limitation may frustrate you.  To work around the one line limitation, press `Shift`+`Enter` instead of `Enter`.  In the following example, the value displayed is the result of all the lines run in order.

:::image type="content" source="../media/console-javascript-multiline.msft.png" alt-text="Press Shift+Enter to write several lines of JavaScript and the resulting value is run in order" lightbox="../media/console-javascript-multiline.msft.png":::

If you start a multiline statement in the **Console**, it gets automatically recognized and indented.  For example, if you start a block statement with a curly brace.

## Network requests using top-level await()

Other than in your own scripts, **Console** supports [top level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await) to run arbitrary asynchronous JavaScript in it.  For example, use the `fetch` API without wrapping the `await` statement with an async function.

To get the last 50 issues that were filed on the [Microsoft Edge Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-edge-devtools) GitHub repo:

1.  Open the **Console**.
1.  Copy and paste the following code snippet to get an object that contains 10 entries.

    ```javascript
    await ( await fetch(
    'https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode-edge-devtools/issues?state=all&per_page=50&page=1'
    )).json();
    ```

:::image type="complex" source="../media/console-javascript-top-level-await.msft.png" alt-text="Console displays the result of a top-level async fetch request" lightbox="../media/console-javascript-top-level-await.msft.png":::
    **Console** displays the result of a top-level async `fetch` request
:::image-end:::

The 10 entries are hard to recognize, since a lot of information is displayed.  You can use the `console.table()` log method to only receive the information in which you're interested.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/console-javascript-filtered-with-table.msft.png" alt-text="Display the last result in a human readable format using console.table" lightbox="../media/console-javascript-filtered-with-table.msft.png":::
    Display the last result in a human readable format using `console.table`
:::image-end:::

To reuse the data returned from an expression, you can use the `copy()` utility method of the **Console**.  The following code snippet sends the request and copies the data from the response to the clipboard.

```javascript
copy(await (await fetch(
'https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode-edge-devtools/issues?state=all&per_page=50&page=1'
)).json())
```

Use the **Console** as a great way to practice JavaScript and to do some quick calculations.  The real power is the fact that you have access to the [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window) object.  You can [use the Console to interact with the DOM](console-dom-interaction.md).
