# Get started analyzing runtime performance

_Runtime performance_ is how your page performs when it's running, as opposed to loading.  The following tutorial teaches you how to use the DevTools **Performance** tool to analyze runtime performance.

In terms of the **RAIL** model, the skills you learn in this tutorial are useful for analyzing the Response, Animation, and Idle phases of your page.

See also [Optimize website speed using Lighthouse](../speed/get-started.md).

<!--todo: add rail link when section is ready -->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Get started

In the following tutorial, you open DevTools on a "Sluggish Animation" demo page and use the **Performance** tool to find a performance bottleneck on the page.

1. Open the [Sluggish Animation](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-performance-get-started/) demo page in your InPrivate tab or window.  To do that, right-click the link and then select **Open link in InPrivate window**.  You'll profile this page, which shows a variable number of icons moving up and down. For more information about InPrivate, see [Browse InPrivate in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/browse-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge-cd2c9a48-0bc4-b98e-5e46-ac40c84e27e2)

   Note: The source for this demo is at [MicrosoftEdge / Demos > devtools-performance-get-started](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/devtools-performance-get-started).


   <!--TODO: replace section when updated for Chromium-based Edge  -->

   <!-- You can view the source files for the "Sluggish Animation" demo page at the [MicrosoftEdge/Demos > devtools-performance-get-started](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/devtools-performance-get-started) repo folder. -->

1. Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (macOS) to open DevTools.

   ![The demo on the left, and DevTools on the right](../media/evaluate-performance-get-started-side-by-side.msft.png)


For the rest of the following screenshots, DevTools is [undocked to a separate window](../customize/placement.md), to better focus on the contents.


### Simulate a mobile CPU

Mobile devices have much less CPU power than desktops and laptops.  Whenever you profile a page, use CPU Throttling to simulate how your page performs on mobile devices.

1. In DevTools, open the **Performance** tool.

1. Select the **Screenshots** checkbox.

1. Click **Capture settings** (![Capture settings](../media/capture-settings-icon.msft.png)).  DevTools reveals settings related to how it captures performance metrics.

1. For **CPU**, select **4x slowdown**.  DevTools throttles your CPU so that it's 4 times slower than usual.

   ![CPU throttle](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-capture-settings.msft.png)

   If you want to ensure that pages work well on low-end mobile devices, set **CPU** to **6x slowdown**.  The demo doesn't work well with 6x slowdown, so it just uses 4x slowdown for instructional purposes.


### Set up the demo

The following section lets you customize the demo to make sure that your experience is relatively consistent with the screenshots and descriptions.

1. Click the **Add 10** button until the blue icons move noticeably slower than before.  On a high-end machine, you can click it about 20 times.

1. Click **Optimize**.  The blue icons should move faster and more smoothly.

1. To better display a difference between the optimized and non-optimized versions, click the **Subtract 10** button a few times and try again.  If you add too many blue icons, you could max out the CPU, and then you might not observe a major difference in the results for the two versions.

1. Click **Un-Optimize**.  The blue icons move slower and with more sluggishness again.


### Record runtime performance

When you ran the optimized version of the page, the blue icons move faster.  Why is that?  Both versions are supposed to move the icons the same amount of space in the same amount of time.  Take a recording in the **Performance** tool to learn how to detect the performance bottleneck in the non-optimized version.

1. In DevTools, click **Record** (![Record](../media/record-icon.msft.png)).  DevTools captures performance metrics as the page runs.

   ![Profile the page](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-profiling.msft.png)

1. Wait a few seconds.

1. Click **Stop**.  DevTools stops recording, processes the data, then displays the results in the **Performance** tool.

   ![The results of the profile](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-capture-results.msft.png)


These performance results show an overwhelming amount of data, but it will all make more sense shortly.



<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Analyze the results

Once you have a recording of the page's performance, you can assess the page's performance and find the cause of any performance issues.

1. The **CPU** chart is displayed along the top.  The colors in the **CPU** chart correspond to the colors in the **Summary** panel, at the bottom of the **Performance** tool.  The **CPU** chart shows that these regions make up a large area, meaning that the CPU was maxed out during the recording.  Whenever the CPU is maxed out for long periods, that's an indicator that the page is not performing well.

   ![The CPU chart and Summary panel](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-cpu-chart.msft.png)

1. Hover over the **CPU** or **NET** charts.  DevTools shows a screenshot of the page at that point in time.  Move your mouse left and right to replay the recording.  The action is called _scrubbing_, and it's useful for manually analyzing the progression of the performance recording.

   ![Hover on a frame](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-frame-hover.msft.png)



#### Bonus: Open the Frame Rendering Stats overlay

Another handy tool is the **Frame Rendering Stats** overlay, which provides real-time estimates for FPS as the page runs. The **Frame Rendering Stats** overlay is not required for this tutorial but may provide helpful insight.

1. In DevTools, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS) to open the **Command Menu**.

1. Start typing `Rendering` in the **Command Menu** and click **Show Rendering**.

1. In the **Rendering** tool, turn on **Frame Rendering Stats**.  A new overlay appears in the top-left of your webpage.

   ![The FPS overlay](../media/evaluate-performance-fps-meter-overlay.msft.png)

1. When you are done reviewing the FPS data, clear the **Frame Rendering Stats** checkbox to hide the overlay.


### Find the bottleneck

After you verified that the animation isn't performing well, the next step is to answer the question "why?"

1. When no events are selected, the **Summary** panel shows you a breakdown of activity.  The page spent most of the time rendering.  Since performance is the art of doing less work, your goal is to reduce the amount of time spent doing rendering work.

   ![The Summary panel](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-summary-tab.msft.png)

1. Expand the **Main** section.  DevTools shows you a flame chart of activity on the main thread, over time.  The x-axis represents the recording, over time.  Each bar represents an event.  A wider bar means that event took longer.  The y-axis represents the call stack.  When events are stacked on top of each other, it means the upper events caused the lower events.

   ![The Main section](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-main.msft.png)

1. There is a lot of data in the recording.  To zoom into a portion of the recording, click and drag in the **Overview** area toward the top of the **Performance** tool.  The **Overview** area includes the **CPU** and **NET** charts (indicated on the right).  The **Main** section and **Summary** panel only display information for the selected portion of the recording.

   ![Zoom into a section](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-main-zoomed.msft.png)

   Another way to change the selected area is to put focus on the **Main** section, click the background or an event, and then press:
   * `W` to zoom in, `S` to zoom out.
   * `A` to move selection left, `D` to move selection right.

1. Select an **Animation Frame Fired** event.  When a red triangle is displayed at the top right of an event, it's a warning that there might be an issue related to the event.

   The **Animation Frame Fired** event occurs whenever a [requestAnimationFrame() callback](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) is run.

1. Click the **Animation Frame Fired** event.  The **Summary** panel now shows you information about that event.  Note the **Reveal** link.  After you click it, DevTools highlights the event that initiated the **Animation Frame Fired** event.  Also, focus on the **app.js:96** link.  After you click it, the relevant line in the source code is displayed.

   ![More information about the Animation Frame Fired event](../media/evaluate-performance-performance-animation-frame-fired.msft.png)

   After clicking an event, use the arrow keys to select the events next to it.

1. Under the **app.update** event, there's a bunch of purple events, and they each have a red triangle.

1. Click one of the purple **Layout** events.  DevTools provides more information about the event in the **Summary** panel.  There is a warning about forced reflows (another word for _layout_).

1. In the **Summary** panel, click the **app.js:72** link under **Layout Forced**.  DevTools takes you to the line of code that forced the layout.

   ![The line of code that caused the forced layout](../media/evaluate-performance-sources-app-update.msft.png)

   The problem with the non-optimized code is that, in each animation frame, it changes the style for each icon, and then queries the position of each icon on the page. Because the styles changed, the browser doesn't know if each icon position changed, so it has to re-layout the icon in order to compute the new position.

   -->


This article gives you a lot to learn. But now you have a solid foundation in the basic workflow for analyzing runtime performance.  Good job.


### Analyze the optimized version

Using the workflows and tools that you just learned, click **Optimize** on the demo to turn on the optimized code, take another performance recording, and then analyze the results.  From the improved framerate to the reduction in events in the flame chart in the **Main** section, the optimized version of the app does much less work, resulting in better performance.

The optimized code uses a different sequence of actions to do less work. Note that this code could be made even faster by only using properties that only affect compositing, instead of manipulating the `top` property of every icon.

## Next steps

<!--The foundation for understanding performance is the RAIL model.  The RAIL model teaches you the performance metrics that are most important to your users.
To learn more, see [Measure Performance With The RAIL Model](https://web.dev/rail/). -->

To get more comfortable with the **Performance** tool, practice makes perfect.  Try profiling your pages and analyzing the results.  If you have any questions about your results, use the **Send Feedback** icon, press `Alt`+`Shift`+`I` (Windows, Linux) or `Option`+`Shift`+`I` (macOS), or [file an issue on the MicrosoftEdge / DevTools repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevTools/issues).  Include screenshots or links to reproducible pages, if possible.

<!-- To really become an expert in runtime performance, you must learn how the browser translates HTML, CSS, and JS into pixels on a screen.  The best place to start is the [Rendering Performance](https://web.dev/rendering-performance/).  [The Anatomy Of A Frame](https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-frame/) dives into even more detail. -->

Last, there are many ways to improve runtime performance.  This article focused on one particular animation bottleneck to give you a focused tour of the **Performance** tool, but it's only one of many bottlenecks you may encounter.  <!--  The rest of the Rendering Performance series has a lot of good tips for improving various aspects of runtime performance, such as:  -->
