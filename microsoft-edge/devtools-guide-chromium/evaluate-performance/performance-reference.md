# Timeline event reference

The timeline events mode displays all events triggered while making a recording.  Use the timeline event reference to learn more about each timeline event type.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Common timeline event properties

Certain details are present in events of all types, while some only apply to certain event types.  This section lists properties common to different event types.  Properties specific to certain event types are listed in the references for those event types that follow.

| Property | When is it shown |
|:--- |:--- |
| Aggregated time | For events with **nested events**, the time taken by each category of events. |
| Call Stack | For events with **child events**, the time taken by each category of events. |
| CPU time | How much CPU time the recorded event took. |
| Details | Other details about the event. |
| Duration (at time-stamp) | How long it took the event with all of its children to complete; timestamp is the time at which the event occurred, relative to when the recording started. |
| Self time | How long the event took without any of its children. |
| Used Heap Size | Amount of memory being used by the application when the event was recorded, and the delta (+/-) change in used heap size since the last sampling. |

<!--todo: add nested and child events (timelinetool) section when available -->

| Cancel Animation Frame |  A scheduled animation frame was canceled. |
| GC Event |  Garbage collection occurred. |
| DOMContentLoaded |  The [DOMContentLoaded event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded) was fired by the browser.  This event is fired when all of the DOM content of the page is loaded and parsed. |
| Evaluate Script | A script was evaluated. |
| Event | A JavaScript event (for example, `mousedown`, or `key`). |
| Function Call | A top-level JavaScript function call was made (only appears when browser enters JavaScript engine). |

| Request Animation Frame | A `requestAnimationFrame()` call scheduled a new frame. |
| Remove Timer | A previously created timer was cleared. |
| Time |  A script called [console.time()](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/console/api#time). |

| Property | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Layout invalidated | For Layout records, the stack trace of the code that caused the layout to be invalidated. |
| Nodes that need layout | For Layout records, the number of nodes that were marked as needing layout before the relayout started.  These are normally those nodes that were invalidated by developer code, plus a path upward to relayout root. |
| Layout tree size | For Layout records, the total number of nodes under the relayout root (the node that Microsoft Edge starts the relayout). |
| Layout scope | Possible values are `Partial` (the re-layout boundary is a portion of the DOM) or `Whole document`. |
| Elements affected | For Recalculate style records, the number of elements affected by a style recalculation. |
