# Experimental features

<!-- 
Policies to keep this page comprehensive and maintainable: 
*  Favor Canary over Stable re: sequencing.
*  Include a visible h2 section for every checkbox that's in public-facing Microsoft Edge DevTools > Experiments page.  If no info, write a tautology as a starting point.  Add as needed, each month.
*  Keep h2 sections in same order as DevTools > Settings > Experiments.
*  In the heading and UI steps, keep the checkbox label UI string as it appears in the UI; do not revise or "fix" it.
*  Don't change h2 text, that might break a link from UI.
*  When a checkbox is removed from all the channels, delete its section.

Steps to maintain this page monthly: For latest Canary, and for latest Stable:
1. Go to edge://settings/help, update if needed.
1. In DevTools, select Settings > Preferences > Restore Defaults > Reload DevTools.
1. In DevTools, go to Settings > Experiments.
1. In the "Experiments which are turned on by default" section below, update the Edge Canary list & Edge Stable list at top.
   *  In that section, link down to the h2; do not link to a different article.
1. Make sure the article has an h2 for each checkbox.
1. In each h2 section, update the presence or absence of "not", and update the version #:
This checkbox is|is not present in Microsoft Edge Canary 123.
This checkbox is|is not present in Microsoft Edge Stable 123.
-->

Microsoft Edge DevTools provide access to experimental features that are still in development.  This article lists and describes the experimental features that are in either:
*  The latest version of the Canary preview channel of Microsoft Edge.
*  The latest version of the Stable release of Microsoft Edge.

All [channels of Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-channels) have experimental features. You can get the latest experimental features by using the [Microsoft Edge Canary channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/welcome?channel=canary). To view the full list available in your version of Microsoft Edge, see the **Settings** > **Experiments** page in DevTools.

<!-- no Warning formatting, because UI already contains red "WARNING" at top -->
These experiments could be unstable or unreliable and may require you to restart DevTools.

## Enable new Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) replacing previous contrast ratio and AA/AAA guidelines

The [Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA)](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/methods/Method-font-characteristic-contrast.html) replaces the [AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref#contrast-minimum)/[AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref#contrast-enhanced) guidelines contrast ratio in the Color Picker.  The Color Picker is used in the **Styles** tab in the **Elements** tool.

APCA is a new way to compute contrast.  It is based on modern research on color perception.  Compared to AA/AAA guidelines, APCA is more context-dependent.  The contrast is calculated based on the following spatial properties of the text, color, and context.

*  Spatial properties of text that include font weight and size.
*  Spatial properties of color that include perceived contrast between text and background.
*  Spatial properties of context that include ambient light, surroundings, and intended purpose.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Highlight important DOM properties in the Object Properties viewer

_new as of Microsoft Edge 105_

Selecting this checkbox causes important DOM properties to be highlighted in the **Properties** tab in tools such as the **Elements** tool, for the DOM tree element that's currently selected.  This new experiment makes major properties easier to see.  Some properties appear in bold, and others appear in bold and have a star icon next to them.

This highlighting is useful because in JavaScript, objects inherit from parent objects, which themselves inherit from other ancestors, sometimes amounting to hundreds of properties.  This experiment helps you find the main properties.

The Object Properties viewer is in several tools, including **Elements**, **Sources**, **Console**, and **Network**.  It provides a tree view of properties of objects.


#### In the Elements tool

To see the Object Properties viewer in the **Elements** tool:

1. Right-click an item in a webpage and then select **Inspect**.  DevTools opens, with the page element selected in the DOM tree of the **Elements** tool.

1. In the **Elements** tool, select the **Properties** tab, which is grouped with the **Styles** tab.

   The **Properties** tab contains the list of properties for the selected element.


#### In the Sources tool

To see the Object Properties viewer in the **Sources** tool:

1. Open a `.js` file.

1. Set a breakpoint on a line of code in the `.js` file.

1. Pause the debugger at that line by running the code on the webpage.

   Object properties are displayed in the **Scope** section in the right-hand sidebar.  See [View and edit properties and variables](../javascript/reference.md#view-and-edit-properties-and-variables) in _JavaScript debugging features_.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable webhint

[webhint](https://webhint.io) is an open-source tool that provides real-time feedback for websites and local webpages.  The type of feedback provided by [webhint](https://webhint.io) includes:

*  Accessibility
*  Cross-browser compatibility
*  Security
*  Performance
*  Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
*  Other common web development issues

The [webhint](https://webhint.io) experiment displays the webhint feedback in the [Issues](../issues/index.md) panel.  Select an issue to display documentation about the solution and a list of the affected resources on your website.  Select a resource link to open the relevant **Network**, **Sources**, or **Elements** pane in DevTools.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Focus Mode

Focus Mode is a new user interface for DevTools.  Focus Mode is designed to simplify and streamline the DevTools UI, without compromising its feature set.

Focus Mode replaces the main row of tabs with an **Activity Bar**, which is a compact toolbar with distinctive icons.  The **Activity Bar** makes it possible to pin, rearrange, and open your favorite tools, for quick access.  The **Activity Bar** also provides access to user settings, help, and other features.

Focus Mode also provides a **Quick View** list, to open a second tool alongside the tool that's already selected in the **Activity Bar**.

See [Reduce the complexity of DevTools with Focus Mode](focus-mode.md).

Status:
*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Canary 107.
*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Stable 105.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open source files in Visual Studio Code

The **Open source files in Visual Studio Code** experiment replaces the code editor of the Sources tool with Visual Studio Code, for editing local files. When you turn on this experiment, Developer Tools detects when you edit a local file, and prompts you to select a folder to use as your Workspace.

When you select a folder to use as your Workspace, selecting any link to a file in DevTools opens the file in Visual Studio Code.  In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, this action opened the file in the code editor of the Sources tool in DevTools.

![Selecting a file link in the Styles tool opens the file in Visual Studio Code.](../media/experiment-sources-in-code-editor-open.msft.png)

Any edits that you make in DevTools now change the file on the hard drive and sync live with Visual Studio Code. You can read about setting up your workspace in [Opening source files in Visual Studio Code](../sources/opening-sources-in-vscode.md).
