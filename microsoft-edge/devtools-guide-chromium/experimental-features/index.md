Microsoft Edge DevTools provide access to experimental features that are still in development.  This article lists and describes most of the experimental features which are in the latest version of the Canary preview channel of Microsoft Edge.

All [channels of Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-channels) have experimental features. You can get the latest experimental features by using the [Microsoft Edge Canary channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/welcome?channel=canary). To view the full list available in your version of Microsoft Edge, see the **Settings** > **Experiments** page in DevTools.

<!-- no Warning formatting, because UI already contains red "WARNING" at top -->
These experiments could be unstable or unreliable and may require you to restart DevTools.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

## List of experiments

Most of the experiments that appear in the latest version of the Canary preview channel of Microsoft Edge are listed below.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Allow extensions to load custom stylesheets
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

Some Microsoft Edge Add-ons can define custom color themes for DevTools. If you install an add-on with a theme, you need to enable the **Allow extensions to load custom stylesheets** experiment to view the add-on themes.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Capture node creation stacks
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

To capture JavaScript stack traces when DOM nodes are added to the DOM at runtime, enable this experiment. The captured stack traces are displayed in the **Stack Trace** pane of the **Elements** panel.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Automatically pretty print in the Sources Panel
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

When this experiment is turned on, when you display a minified file in the Sources panel, the file is opened in a single tab in the Sources panel, pretty-printed.

When this experiment is turned off, a UI prompt with a button asks you whether to pretty-print the file.  The file is opened in an additional tab which has an appended suffix of **:formatted**.

*  A _minified_ file is concatenated into a single long line.
*  In contrast, _pretty print_ presents the contents of a file in an indented, more human-readable format.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Protocol Monitor
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

DevTools communicates with the inspected page using the DevTools protocol.

To monitor the messages sent and received by DevTools to debug the inspected page:

1.  [Open DevTools](../open/index.md).  For example, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (on Windows/Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (on macOS).

1.  In DevTools, select **Settings** > **Experiments**.

1.  Select the **Protocol Monitor** checkbox, and then click **Close** (![The Close icon in DevTools > Settings.](../media/settings-close-icon-light-theme.png)) to close **Settings**.

1.  Open the **Command Menu** (`Control`+`Shift`+`P`), and then type **protocol** in the text box.

1.  Select **Show Protocol monitor**.  The message appears: "One or more settings have changed which requires a reload to take effect."

1.  Click the **Reload DevTools** button that appears next to the message.

1.  The **Protocol monitor** tool is displayed in the **Drawer** at the bottom of DevTools.

## Source order viewer
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

**Source Order Viewer** is an experiment that displays the order of elements in the webpage source. The on-screen display order can differ from the order of the source, which confuses screen reader and keyboard users. Use the **Source Order Viewer** experiment to find the differences between on-screen display order and the order of the source.

To use the **Source Order Viewer**:

1.  [Open DevTools](../open/index.md).  For example, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (on Windows/Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (on macOS).

1.  Open the **Elements** tool.

1.  To the right of the **Styles** tab, click the **Accessibility** tab.

1.  Under the **Source Order Viewer** section, select the **Show Source Order** checkbox.

1.  Highlight any HTML element to display an overlay of the order in the webpage source.

This experiment is turned on by default.

For more information, see [Test keyboard support using the Source Order Viewer](../accessibility/test-tab-key-source-order-viewer.md)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable back-forward cache debugging support
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

Back-forward cache, or *bfcache*. Makes navigating through your browsing history faster by saving snapshots of visited web pages in memory.

Certain web pages can't be cached. Enable this experiment to add the **Back-forward Cache** section to the **Application** panel.  Enabling back-forward cache debugging provides information about web pages that can't be stored in `bfcache`.

Enable this experiment to add the **Reporting API** section in the **Application** panel, which lists all of the reports sent to the endpoint.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<!-- ## Log DevTools uncaught exceptions to Console -->
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

<!-- Needs content. -->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable webhint
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

[webhint](https://webhint.io) is an open-source tool that provides real-time feedback for websites and local webpages.  The type of feedback provided by [webhint](https://webhint.io) includes:

*   Accessibility
*   Cross-browser compatibility
*   Security
*   Performance
*   Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
*   Other common web development issues

The [webhint](https://webhint.io) experiment displays the webhint feedback in the [Issues](../issues/index.md) panel.  Select an issue to display documentation about the solution and a list of the affected resources on your website.  Select a resource link to open the relevant **Network**, **Sources**, or **Elements** pane in DevTools.

:::image type="content" source="../media/experiments-webhint.msft.png" alt-text="webhint feedback in the Issues panel" lightbox="../media/experiments-webhint.msft.png":::

This experiment is turned on by default.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

## Show issues in Elements
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

Enable this experiment to view syntax errors under HTML in the **DOM** view of the **Elements** tool. For more information, see [Wavy underlines highlight code issues and improvements in Elements tool](../whats-new/2021/04/devtools.md#wavy-underlines-highlight-code-issues-and-improvements-in-elements-tool).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable Composited Layers in 3D View
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

You can visualize Layers alongside z-indexes and the Document Object Model (DOM). For a comprehensive visual debugging experience, the 3D View and Composited Layers are now combined.

This feature helps you debug without switching contexts as often. Reducing context-switching resolves a major pain point for developers. This feature makes it clear how the code you write affects your web app.

To use **Composited Layers**:

1.  [Open DevTools](../open/index.md).  For example, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (on Windows/Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (on macOS).

1.  Press `Esc` to display the **Drawer**.

1.  On the **Drawer**, select the **3D View** tool.

1.  Open the **Composited Layers** pane.

1.  All of the painted layers of the app are displayed.  Try this feature with your own web apps.

:::image type="content" source="../media/experiments-layers.msft.png" alt-text="Composited Layers pane" lightbox="../media/experiments-layers.msft.png":::

This experiment is turned on by default.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Enable Network Console
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

**Network Console** is the working title of an experiment to make synthetic network requests over HTTP.  You can use the **Network Console** experiment to send web API requests.

To use the **Network Console**:

1.  [Open DevTools](../open/index.md).  For example, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (on Windows/Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (on macOS).

1.  Open the **Network** pane.

1.  Right-click the network request that you want to change and resend, and then select **Edit and Replay**.

1.  In the **Network Console**, edit the network request information.

1.  Click **Send**.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Focus Mode

The Focus Mode experiment provides an **Activity Bar**, which is a compact horizontal or vertical toolbar that keeps the DevTools UI clean and works well with a smaller window.  Pin your current main tools to the Activity Bar.

:::image type="content" source="../media/experimental-features/focus-mode.png" alt-text="Focus Mode, including the Activity Bar.":::

See also [DevTools: Focus Mode UI](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/DevTools/FocusMode/explainer.md) in the `MSEdgeExplainers` repo.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## DevTools Tooltips
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

Enable this experiment to view tooltips for all the different tools and panes in DevTools. For more information, see [Learn about DevTools with informative tooltips](../whats-new/2021/04/devtools.md#learn-about-devtools-with-informative-tooltips).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Detached Elements
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

<!-- maintainers: see notes about this experiment, in the list of experiments which are turned on by default, at top of article -->

Memory leaks in web applications can be difficult to locate and repair.

The new **Detached Elements** panel in Microsoft Edge DevTools helps investigate and resolve a common source of memory leaks.

Memory leaks occur when the JavaScript code of the application retains an increasing number of objects in memory. The JavaScript code should release these objects so that the memory space can be reused by the browser.

For more information, see [Debug DOM memory leaks with the Detached Elements tool](../memory-problems/dom-leaks.md)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## VS Code themes for the DevTools
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->
<!-- preserve literal UI string, including "VS" & "the" -->

To use Visual Studio themes in DevTools, enable the **VS Code themes for the DevTools** experiment. For more information, see [Apply color themes to DevTools](../customize/theme.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open source files in Visual Studio Code
<!-- present in 96, 98 -->

The **Open source files in Visual Studio Code** experiment replaces the code editor of the Sources tool with Visual Studio Code, for editing local files. When you turn on this experiment, Developer Tools detects when you edit a local file, and prompts you to select a folder to use as your Workspace.

When you select a folder to use as your Workspace, selecting any link to a file in DevTools opens the file in Visual Studio Code.  In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, this action opened the file in the code editor of the Sources tool in DevTools.

:::image type="content" source="../media/experiment-sources-in-code-editor-open.msft.png" alt-text="Selecting a file link in the Styles tool opens the file in Visual Studio Code" lightbox="../media/experiment-sources-in-code-editor-open.msft.png":::

Any edits that you make in DevTools now change the file on the hard drive and sync live with Visual Studio Code. You can read about setting up your workspace in [Opening source files in Visual Studio Code](../sources/opening-sources-in-vscode.md).

## Previously Experimental features which are now regular features

These features have been promoted from experimental to regular features, and have been removed from **Settings** > **Experiments**.

*  [Turn on new CSS grid debugging features](../css/grid.md) - removed from experimental status starting with Microsoft Edge 89.

*  [Match keyboard shortcuts from Microsoft Visual Studio Code](../customize/shortcuts.md#match-keyboard-shortcuts-from-visual-studio-code) - removed from experimental status starting with Microsoft Edge 86.

*  [Turn on support to move tabs between panels](../customize/index.md) - removed from experimental status starting with Microsoft Edge 85.

*  [3D View](../3d-view/index.md) - removed from experimental status starting with Microsoft Edge 83.

*  The items in the following subsections.

### Enable + button tab menus to open more tools

This experiment started with Microsoft Edge version 89, and is a regular feature as of version 94.

You can now open more tools using the new **More Tools** (![The 'More Tools' icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) icon.  After you turn on the **Enable + button tab menus to open more tools** experiment and reload DevTools, a plus sign (![The 'More Tools' icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) appears to the right of the tab group at the top of DevTools.  To display a list of other tools that you can add to the tab bar, click the **More Tools** (![The 'More Tools' icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) icon.

:::image type="content" source="../media/experiments-more-tools-button.msft.png" alt-text="More Tools in the top pane." lightbox="../media/experiments-more-tools-button.msft.png":::

### Enable Welcome tab

The Welcome tab was an experiment starting with Microsoft Edge version 89. It is a regular feature as of version 94.

This experiment replaces the **What's New** tool with the new **Welcome** tool.  It displays a refreshed design for the following content.

*   Links to developer docs
*   Latest features
*   Release notes
*   Option to contact the Microsoft Edge DevTools team

The **Welcome** tool opens automatically after each update to Microsoft Edge.  To prevent the display of the **Welcome** tool after each update, clear the checkbox next to **Open tab after each update** under the **Welcome** tool title.

:::image type="content" source="../media/experiments-welcome.msft.png" alt-text="Welcome tool" lightbox="../media/experiments-welcome.msft.png":::

### Enable new CSS Flexbox debugging features

This was an experiment starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, and is a regular feature as of version 94.

This feature provides many new visualizations to help you debug CSS Flexbox layouts.

#### Displaying persistent overlays on Flexbox layouts with the Inspect tool

The **Inspect** tool provides a quick way to identify and visualize CSS Flexbox layouts in a website by hovering on them with the mouse.  Select the **Inspect** (![Inspect](../media/inspect-icon.msft.png)) icon in the top-left corner of DevTools.  Then, while debugging the website, hover on a flex container to display outlines around the flex container.

:::image type="content" source="../media/flexbox-hover.msft.png" alt-text="Display Flexbox containers with the Inspect tool" lightbox="../media/flexbox-hover.msft.png":::

#### Displaying persistent overlays on Flexbox layouts

In Microsoft Edge version 89 or later, the CSS Flexbox feature offers the option to turn on persistent overlays on Flexbox layouts.  Persistent overlays provide the following benefits:
*   Persistent overlays remain visible on the webpage as you scroll, move your mouse, and use other features of DevTools.
*   Multiple persistent overlays can be used at the same time, to allow you to review several Flexbox layouts at once.
*   Persistent overlays offer color configuration options.

To toggle persistent overlays on Flexbox layout, do either of the following:
*   Select the **Flexbox** oval icon next to any Flexbox container displayed in the DOM tree of the **Elements** tool.
*   Open the new **Layout** panel located in the **Elements** tool, and select the checkbox next to each Flexbox container you want to highlight.

:::image type="content" source="../media/flexbox-overlay.msft.png" alt-text="Flex icons and Layout panel in DevTools" lightbox="../media/flexbox-overlay.msft.png":::

#### Configuring persistent overlays

To configure options for persistent overlays for CSS grids or Flexbox layouts, use the **Layout** pane.  The **Layout** pane is located in the **Elements** tool next to the **Styles** and **Computed** panes.

:::image type="content" source="../media/flexbox-layout.msft.png" alt-text="Layout panel" lightbox="../media/flexbox-layout.msft.png":::
