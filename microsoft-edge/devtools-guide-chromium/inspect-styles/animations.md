# Inspect animations   



Inspect and modify animations with the Microsoft Edge DevTools Animation Inspector.

> ![animation inspector][ImageAnimationInspector]  

### Summary  

*   Capture animations by opening the Animation Inspector.  The Animation Inspector automatically detects and sorts animations into groups.  
*   Inspect animations by slowing down each one, replaying each one, or viewing the source code.  
*   Modify animations by changing the timing, delay, duration, or keyframe offsets.  

## Overview   

The Microsoft Edge DevTools Animation Inspector has two main purposes.  

*   Inspecting animations.  You want to slow down, replay, or inspect the source code for an Animation Group.  
*   Modifying animations.  You want to modify the timing, delay, duration, or keyframe offsets of an Animation Group.  Bezier editing and keyframe editing are currently not supported.  

The Animation Inspector supports CSS animations, CSS transitions, and web animations.  `requestAnimationFrame` animations are currently not supported.  

### What is an Animation Group?  

An Animation Group is a group of animations that may be related to each other.  Currently, the web has no real concept of a group animation, so motion designers and developers have to compose and time individual animations so that the animations render as one coherent visual effect.  The Animation Inspector predicts which animations are related based on start time \(excluding delays, and so on\).  The Animation Inspector also groups the animations side-by-side.  
In other words, a set of animations that are all triggered in the same script block are grouped together.  If an animation is asynchronous, it is placed in a separate group.  

## Get started  

There are two ways to open the Animation Inspector:  

*   Open the **Customize and Control DevTools** menu  
    1.  Navigate to the **More tools** sub-menu.  
    1.  Select **Animations**:  
        
        > ##### Figure 2  
        > Animations via Main Menu  
        > ![Animations via Main Menu][ImageAnimationsViaMainMenu]  
        
*   Open the **Command Menu**  
    1.  Type `Drawer: Show Animations`.  

The Animation Inspector opens up as a tab next to the Console Drawer.  Since the Animation Inspector is a Drawer tab, you may use the Animation Inspector from any DevTools panel.

The Animation Inspector is grouped into four main sections \(or panes\).  This guide refers to each pane as follows:  

| | Pane | Description |  
| --- |:--- |:--- |  
| 1 | **Controls** | From here you may clear all currently captured Animation Groups, or change the speed of the currently selected Animation Group. |  
| 2 | **Overview** | Select an Animation Group here to inspect and modify it in the **Details** pane. |  
| 3 | **Timeline** | Pause and start an animation from here, or jump to a specific point in the animation. |  
| 4 | **Details** | Inspect and modify the currently selected Animation Group. |  

> ##### Figure 4  
> Annotated Animation Inspector  
> ![Annotated Animation Inspector][ImageAnnotatedAnimationInspector]  

To capture an animation, just perform the interaction that triggers the animation while the Animation Inspector is open.  If an animation is triggered on page load, reload the page with the Animation Inspector open to detect the animation.

## Inspect animations   

After you capture an animation, there are a few ways to replay it:  

*   Hover over the thumbnail in the **Overview** pane to view a preview of it.  
*   Select the Animation Group from the **Overview** pane \(so that it is displayed in the **Details** pane\) and press the **replay** ![replay icon][ImageReplayButtonIcon] icon.  The animation is replayed in the viewport.  Click on the **animation speed** ![animation speed icons][ImageAnimationSpeedButtonsIcon] icons to change the preview speed of the currently selected Animation Group.  You may use the red vertical bar to change your current position.  
*   Click and drag the red vertical bar to scrub the viewport animation.  

### View animation details  

After you capture an Animation Group, click on it from the **Overview** pane to view the details.  In the **Details** pane each individual animation is assigned the a row.  

> ##### Figure 5  
> Animation Group details  
> ![Animation Group details][ImageAnimationGroupDetails]  

Hover over an animation to highlight it in the viewport.  Click on the animation to select it in the **Elements** panel.  

> ##### Figure 6  
> Hover over the animation to highlight it in viewport  
> ![Hover over the animation to highlight it in viewport][ImageHoverOverAnimationHighlightViewport]  

The leftmost, darker section of an animation is the definition.  The right, more faded section represents iterations.  For example, in [Figure 7](#figure-7), sections two and three represent iterations of section one.  

> ##### Figure 7  
> Diagram of animation iterations  
> ![Diagram of animation iterations][ImageDiagramAnimationIterations]  

If two elements have the same animation applied, the Animation Inspector assigns the same color to the elements.  The color is random and has no significance.  For example, in [Figure 8](#figure-8) the two elements `div.cwccw.earlier` and `div.cwccw.later` have the same animation \(`spinrightleft`\) applied, as do the `div.ccwcw.earlier` and `div.ccwcw.later` elements.

## Modify animations   

There are three ways you are able to modify an animation with the Animation Inspector:  

*   Animation duration.  
*   Keyframe timings.  
*   Start time delay.  

For this section suppose that [Figure 9](#figure-9) represents the original animation:  

> ##### Figure 9  
> Original animation before modification  
> ![Original animation before modification][ImageOriginalAnimationBeforeModification]  

To change the duration of an animation, click and drag the first or last circle.  

> ##### Figure 10  
> Modified duration  
> ![Modified duration][ImageModifiedDuration]  

If the animation defines any keyframe rules, then these are represented as white inner circles.  Click and drag one of these to change the timing of the keyframe.  

> ##### Figure 11  
> Modified keyframe  
> ![Modified keyframe][ImageModifiedKeyframe]  

To add a delay to an animation, click and drag it anywhere except the circles.  

> ##### Figure 12  
> Modified delay  
> ![Modified delay][ImageModifiedDelay]
