# View and edit session storage

To view, edit, and delete [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) key-value pairs, use the **Application** tool.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## View sessionStorage keys and values

To view the `sessionStorage` key-value pairs of a domain:

1. In DevTools, click the **Application** tab to open the **Application** tool.  The **Manifest** panel is shown by default:

   ![The Manifest pane](./sessionstorage-images/storage-application-manifest.png)

1. In the **Storage** section on the left, expand **Session storage**:

   ![The Session Storage Menu](./sessionstorage-images/storage-application-storage-session-storage.png)

1. In the **Session storage** on the left, select a domain.  The domain's key-value pairs are listed in the upper right:

   ![The sessionStorage key-value pairs](./sessionstorage-images/storage-application-storage-session-storage-domain.png)

1. Select a row of the key-value table.  The value for the selected key is displayed below the key-value table:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Create a new sessionStorage key-value pair

To add a new key/value pair for session storage:

1. In DevTools, in the **Application** tool, in the **Storage** section on the left, expand **Session storage**, and then select a domain.  For details, see [View sessionStorage keys and values](#view-sessionstorage-keys-and-values), above.

1. In the **Key/Value** table on the right, double-click an empty key/value row, to enter editing mode.

1. In the **Key** field of the row, enter a key.

1. In the **Value** field of the row, enter a value for the key.

1. Press **Enter**, or click an empty area.  The value is then also displayed below the key/value table:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edit sessionStorage keys or values

To edit a key/value pair for session storage:

1. In DevTools, in the **Application** tool, in the **Storage** section on the left, expand **Session storage**, and then select a domain.  For details, see [View sessionStorage keys and values](#view-sessionstorage-keys-and-values), above.

1. In the **Key/Value** table on the right, double-click a cell in the **Key** or **Value** column to edit that key or value:

   ![Edit a sessionStorage key](./sessionstorage-images/storage-application-storage-session-storage-domain-key-value-edit.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Delete sessionStorage key-value pairs

To delete a key/value pair for session storage:

1. In DevTools, in the **Application** tool, in the **Storage** section on the left, expand **Session storage**, and then select a domain.  For details, see [View sessionStorage keys and values](#view-sessionstorage-keys-and-values), above.

1. In the **Key/Value** table on the right, select a key-value pair to highlight it.

1. Press `Delete`, or click the **Delete Selected** (![Delete Selected](./sessionstorage-images/delete-icon.png)) button, or right-click the row and then select **Delete**.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Delete all sessionStorage key-value pairs for a domain

To delete all key/value pairs for session storage for a domain:

1. In DevTools, in the **Application** tool, in the **Storage** section on the left, expand **Session storage**, and then select a domain.  For details, see [View sessionStorage keys and values](#view-sessionstorage-keys-and-values), above.

1. Click the **Clear All** (![Clear All](./sessionstorage-images/clear-icon.png)) button.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Interact with sessionStorage from the Console

You can run JavaScript expressions and statements in the **Console**, and the **Console** has access to the JavaScript contexts of the page, including for `sessionStorage`.

To interact with `sessionStorage` by using the **Console**:

1. In DevTools, select the **Console** tool.  For example, press **Esc** to display the **Quick View** panel, which always includes a **Console** tab.

1. If you want to access the `sessionStorage` key-value pairs of a domain other than the page you're on, use the **JavaScript contexts** menu to change the JavaScript context of the **Console**:

   ![Change the JavaScript context of the Console](./sessionstorage-images/storage-console-domain-selection.png)

   In this scenario, there would be multiple domains listed below **top**.

1. Enter `sessionStorage` JavaScript expressions in the **Console**:

   ![Interact with sessionStorage from the Console](./sessionstorage-images/storage-console-session-storage-keys.png)

   The above screenshot shows the following JavaScript expressions, and the resulting output:

   ```js
   > sessionStorage.key(0)
   <路 'my-key-01'
   > sessionStorage.key(1)
   <路 'my-key-02'
   > sessionStorage.setItem("my-key-01", "efgh-5678")
   <路 undefined
   > sessionStorage.getItem("my-key-01")
   <路 'efgh-5678'
   ```

   When you enter JavaScript assignment expressions by using the **Console**, the **Key/Value** pair table is updated.
