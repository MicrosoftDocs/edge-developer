# View, edit, and delete cookies

[HTTP Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) are mainly used to manage user sessions, store user personalization preferences, and track user behavior.  Cookies are also the cause of all of the annoying **this page uses cookies** consent forms that are found across the web.  The following guide teaches you how to view, edit, and delete the HTTP cookies for a webpage with [Microsoft Edge DevTools](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open the Cookies pane

1.  [Open DevTools](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/open).
1.  Choose the **Application** tab to open the **Application** panel.  The **Manifest** pane should open.

## Fields

The **Cookies** table contains the following fields.

*   **Name**.  The name of the cookie.
*   **Value**.  The value of the cookie.
*   **Domain**.  The hosts that are allowed to receive the cookie.  Navigate to [Scope of cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Scope_of_cookies).
*   **Path**.  The URL that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the `Cookie` header.  Navigate to [Scope of cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Scope_of_cookies).
*   **Expires / Max-Age**.  The expiration date or maximum age of the cookie.  Navigate to [Permanent cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Permanent_cookies).  For [session cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Session_cookies) this value is always `Session`.
*   **Size**.  The size, in bytes, of the cookie.
*   **HTTP**.  If true, this field indicates that the cookie should only be used over HTTP and JavaScript modification is not allowed.  Navigate to [HttpOnly cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies).
*   **Secure**.  If true, this field indicates that the cookie must be sent to the server only over a secure, HTTPS connection.  Navigate to [Secure cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies).
*   **SameSite**.  Contains `strict` or `lax` if the cookie is using the experimental [Samesite](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies) attribute.
