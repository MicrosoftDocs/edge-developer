# View, edit, and delete cookies with Microsoft Edge DevTools  

[HTTP Cookies][MDNHTTPCookies] are mainly used to manage user sessions, store user personalization preferences, and track user behavior.  Cookies are also the cause of all of the annoying "this page uses cookies" consent forms that you see across the web.  The following guide teaches you how to view, edit, and delete the HTTP cookies for a page with [Microsoft Edge DevTools][MicrosoftEdgeDevTools].  

## Open the Cookies pane  

1.  [Open DevTools][DevToolsOpen].  
1.  Select the **Application** tab to open the **Application** panel.  The **Manifest** pane should open.  
    
    :::image type="complex" source="../media/storage-application-manifest-empty.msft.png" alt-text="The Manifest pane" lightbox="../media/storage-application-manifest-empty.msft.png":::
       Figure 1:  The Manifest pane  
    :::image-end:::  

1.  Under **Storage** expand **Cookies**, then select an origin.

## Fields  

The **Cookies** table contains the following fields.  

*   **Name**.  The name of the cookie.  
*   **Value**.  The value of the cookie.  
*   **Domain**.  The hosts that are allowed to receive the cookie.  See [Scope of cookies][MDNHTTPCookiesScope].  
*   **Path**.  The URL that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the `Cookie` header.  See [Scope of cookies][MDNHTTPCookiesScope].  
*   **Expires / Max-Age**.  The expiration date or maximum age of the cookie.  See [Permanent cookies][MDNHTTPCookiesPermanent].  For [session cookies][MDNHTTPCookiesSession] this value is always `Session`.  
*   **Size**.  The size, in bytes, of the cookie.  
*   **HTTP**.  If true, this field indicates that the cookie should only be used over HTTP and JavaScript modification is not allowed.  See [HttpOnly cookies][MDNHTTPCookiesSecure].  
*   **Secure**.  If true, this field indicates that the cookie must be sent to the server only over a secure, HTTPS connection.  See [Secure cookies][MDNHTTPCookiesSecure].  
*   **SameSite**.  Contains `strict` or `lax` if the cookie is using the experimental [Samesite][MDNHTTPCookiesSamesite] attribute.  
*   **Priority**.  Contains `low`, `medium` \(default\), or `high` if the cookie is using the deprecated [cookie Priority][ChromiumIssue232693] attribute.

## Filter cookies  

Use the **Filter** text box to filter cookies by **Name** or **Value**.  Filtering by other fields is not supported.

:::image-end:::  

## Edit a cookie  

The **Name**, **Value**, **Domain**, **Path**, and **Expires / Max-Age** fields are editable.  
Double-click a field to edit it.  

:::image type="complex" source="../media/storage-application-storage-cookies-rename.msft.png" alt-text="Setting the name of a cookie to DEVTOOLS!" lightbox="../media/storage-application-storage-cookies-rename.msft.png":::

:::image-end:::  

## Delete cookies

:::image type="complex" source="../media/storage-application-storage-cookies-delete-selected.msft.png" alt-text="Deleting a specific cookie" lightbox="../media/storage-application-storage-cookies-delete-selected.msft.png":::
