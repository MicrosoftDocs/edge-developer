# Lighthouse tool

Use the Lighthouse tool to identify and fix common problems that affect your site's performance, accessibility, and user experience.

The Lighthouse tool was previously called the _Audits_ tool.

See:
* [Test accessibility using Lighthouse](../accessibility/lighthouse.md)
* [Establish a baseline](../speed/get-started.md#establish-a-baseline) in _Optimize website speed using Lighthouse_
