# Get Started with Remote Debugging Surface Duo emulators

In this article, you walk through the process of remotely debugging your web content in the [Microsoft Edge app][AndroidEdge] on a [Surface Duo][SurfaceDuo] emulator from a desktop instance of [Microsoft Edge][DesktopEdge]. For information on debugging on a Surface Duo device, follow our guide for [remote debugging Android devices][RemoteDebuggingAndroid].

## Step 1: Navigate to edge://inspect

Open a desktop instance of [Microsoft Edge][DesktopEdge], and navigate to `edge://inspect`.

> ##### Figure 1  
> The `edge://inspect` page in Microsoft Edge on the desktop
> ![The edge://inspect page in Microsoft Edge on the desktop][ImageEdgeInspect]

> [!NOTE]
> The `edge://inspect` page may not recognize the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator] if you launch the emulator first and then navigate to the `edge://inspect` page. Follow the steps in order to avoid having to restart the emulator.

## Step 2: Launch the Surface Duo emulator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must get the [Surface Duo SDK][DuoSdk] in order to successfully run the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator]. Check out [this guide for the Surface Duo SDK][DuoSdkdocs] first before trying the remaining steps.

Launch the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator].

## Step 3: Load your web content in Microsoft Edge on the Surface Duo emulator

Drag the Favorites Tray up on either screen of the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator] to pull up the Apps Drawer. Click **Edge** to launch the [Microsoft Edge app][AndroidEdge] app on the emulator.

Navigate to the website or app that you want to debug in the [Microsoft Edge app][AndroidEdge].

## Step 4: Debug your web content from the Surface Duo emulator in desktop Microsoft Edge

Switch back to the desktop instance of [Microsoft Edge][DesktopEdge]. The `edge://inspect` page now shows the **SurfaceDuoEmulator** with a list of the open tabs or [PWAs][PwaDocs] that are running on the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator].

> ##### Figure 4
> The `edge://inspect` page displays a list of the open tabs in the Microsoft Edge app running on the emulator
> ![The edge://inspect page displays a list of the open tabs in the Microsoft Edge app running on the emulator][ImageEdgeInspectTargets]  

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not see **SurfaceDuoEmulator** on the `edge://inspect` page, try opening or closing tabs in the [Microsoft Edge app][AndroidEdge] on the [Surface Duo Emulator][DuoEmulator]. For additional troubleshooting steps, see the [troubleshooting section for Android devices][TroubleshootingAndroid].

From the list of open tabs running on the emulator, choose **inspect** on the tab that has the web content to be debugged. The [Microsoft Edge DevTools][DevToolsDocs] will open in a new window. Choose **Toggle Screencast** ![Toggle Screencast][ImageToggleScreencastIcon] to view the web content from your [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator] in the DevTools window. You are now able to use the Microsoft Edge DevTools to debug your web content on the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator].

> [!NOTE]
> If you span the [Microsoft Edge app][AndroidEdge] across both screens in the emulator, the screencast will reflect the new size of the app but not the hinge. To understand how the hinge impacts the layout of your web content, use the [Surface Duo emulator][DuoEmulator] instead of the screencast.

## Additional Resources

The web is a great platform for the new class of foldable and dual-screen devices because you can write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript once and have it look great across single-screen, dual-screen, and foldable devices. For more information, see these additional resources to get started building web content for these new devices.
