# Sources panel overview  

Use the Microsoft Edge DevTools **Sources** panel to perform the following actions.  

*   [Display files](#display-files).  
*   [Edit CSS and JavaScript](#edit-css-and-javascript).  
*   [Create and save **Snippets** of JavaScript](#create-save-and-run-snippets), which you may run on any webpage.  **Snippets** are similar to bookmarklets.  
*   [Debug JavaScript](#debug-javascript).  
*   [Set up a Workspace](#set-up-a-workspace), so that changes you make in DevTools get saved to the code on your file system.  
    
## Display files  

Use the **Page** panel; to display all of the resources that the page has loaded.

   The **Page** panel  
:::image-end:::  

How the **Page** pane is organized:  
*   The top-level, such as `top` in the previous figure, represents an [HTML frame][W3CHtml4Frames].  Find `top` on every page that you visit.  `top` represents the main document frame.  
*   The second-level, such as `docs.microsoft.com` in the previous figure, represents an [origin][HtmlstandardOrigin].  
*   The third-level, fourth-level, and so on, represent directories and resources that were loaded from that origin.  For example, in the previous figure the full path to the resource `devtools-guide-chromium` is `docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium`  
    
Choose a file in the **Page** panel to display the contents in the **Editor** pane.  You may display any type of file.  For images, a preview of the image is displayed.  

:::image type="complex" source="../media/sources-editor-pane.msft.png" alt-text="Display the contents of a4d10f71.index-docs.js in the Editor pane" lightbox="../media/sources-editor-pane.msft.png":::
   Display the contents of `a4d10f71.index-docs.js` in the **Editor** panel  
:::image-end:::  

## Edit CSS and JavaScript  

Use the **Editor** pane to edit CSS and JavaScript.  DevTools updates the page to run your new code.  For example, if you edit a CSS file by adding the style rule below:

```css
.metadata.page-metadata {
    color: red;
}
```

That change should take effect immediately.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/edit-css.msft.png" alt-text="Edit CSS in the Editor pane to change the text color of the subtitle to red" lightbox="../media/edit-css.msft.png":::
   Edit CSS in the **Editor** pane to change the text color of the subtitle to red  
:::image-end:::  

CSS changes take effect immediately, no save needed.  For JavaScript changes to take effect, select `Control`+`S` \(Windows, Linux\) or `Command`+`S` \(macOS\).  DevTools does not re-run a script, so the only JavaScript changes that take effect are those that you make inside of functions.  For example, in the following figure, notice how `console.log('A')` does not run, whereas `console.log('B')` does.  If DevTools re-runs the entire script after making the change, then the text `A` is logged to the **Console**.

   Editing JavaScript in the **Editor** panel  
:::image-end:::  

DevTools erases your CSS and JavaScript changes when you refresh the page.  Navigate to [Set up a Workspace](#set-up-a-workspace) to learn how to save the changes to your file system.  

## Create, save, and run Snippets  

Snippets are scripts which you may run on any page.  Imagine that you repeatedly type out the following code in the **Console**, in order to insert the jQuery library into a page, so that you may run jQuery commands from the **Console**.  

```javascript
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js';
script.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
script.integrity = 'sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4=';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```  

Instead, you may save this code in a **Snippet** and run it with a couple of button clicks, any time you need it.  DevTools saves the **Snippet** to your file system.  

:::image type="complex" source="../media/snippet.msft.png" alt-text="A Snippet that inserts the jQuery library into a page" lightbox="../media/snippet.msft.png":::
   A **Snippet** that inserts the jQuery library into a page  
:::image-end:::  

To run a **Snippet**:

*   Open the file using the **Snippets** panel, and choose **Run** \(![The Run button](../media/run-snippet-icon.msft.png)\).  
*   Open the [Command Menu][DevtoolsGuideChromiumCommandMenuIndex], delete the `>` character, type `!`, type the name of your **Snippet**, and then select `Enter`.  
    
Navigate to [Run Snippets Of Code From Any Page][DevtoolsGuideChromiumJavascriptSnippets] to learn more.

## Debug JavaScript  

Rather than using `console.log()` to infer where your JavaScript is going wrong, consider using the Microsoft Edge DevTools debugging tools, instead.  The general idea is to set a breakpoint, which is an intentional stopping place in your code, and then step through the runtime of your code, one line at a time.  As you step through the code, you may display and change the values of all currently-defined properties and variables, run JavaScript in the **Console**, and more.

Navigate to [Get Started With Debugging JavaScript][DevtoolsGuideChromiumJavascriptIndex] to learn the basics of debugging in DevTools.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/debugging.msft.png" alt-text="Debug JavaScript" lightbox="../media/debugging.msft.png":::
   Debug JavaScript  
:::image-end:::  

## Set up a Workspace  

By default, when you edit a file in the **Sources** tool, those changes are lost when you refresh the page.  **Workspaces** enable you to save the changes that you make in DevTools to your file system.  Essentially, DevTools is able to be used as your code editor.

Navigate to [Edit Files With Workspaces][DevtoolsGuideChromiumWorkspacesIndex] to get started.
