# Understand security issues using the Security tool

<!--Use the **Security** Panel in DevTools to make sure HTTPS is properly implemented on a page.  See **Why HTTPS Matters** to learn why every website should be protected with HTTPS, even sites that don't handle sensitive user data.  -->

<!--todo: add section when why-https is available -->

Use the **Security** panel to inspect the security of a page.

1. To open DevTools, right-click a webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the main toolbar, click the **Security** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More tabs** (![More tabs icon](../media/more-tabs-icon-light-theme.png)) button, or else the **More Tools** (![More Tools icon](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

   The **Security** tool (or _panel_) opens:

## Common problems

### Non-secure main origins

When the main origin of a page isn't secure, the **Security Overview** says **This page is not secure**.

![A non-secure page](../media/security-security-overview-non-secure.msft.png)

This problem occurs when the URL that you visited was requested over HTTP.  To make it secure you need to request it over HTTPS.  For example, if you look at the URL in your address bar, it probably looks similar to `http://example.com`.  To make it secure the URL should be `https://example.com`.

If you already set up HTTPS on your server, all you need to do to fix this problem is configure your server to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

If you haven't set up HTTPS on your server, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) provides a free and relatively easy way to start the process.  Or, you might consider hosting your site on a CDN.  Most major CDNs host sites on HTTPS by default now.

> [!TIP]
> The [Use HTTPS](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-https-only) hint in [webhint](https://webhint.io) can help automate the process of making sure that all HTTP requests are directed to HTTPS.

### Mixed content

**Mixed content**<!--[mixed content](/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content)--> means that the main origin of a page is secure, but the page requested resources from non-secure origins.  Mixed content pages are only partially protected because the HTTP content is accessible to sniffers and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

In the previous figure, select **View 1 request in Network panel** to open the **Network** tool and apply the `mixed-content:displayed` filter so that the **Network Log** only shows non-secure resources.

## View details

### View main origin certificate

From the **Security Overview**, click **View certificate** to quickly inspect the certificate for the main origin.

### View origin details

Click one of the entries in the left-hand nav to view the details of the origin.  From the details page you can view connection and certificate information.  Certificate transparency information is also shown when available.
