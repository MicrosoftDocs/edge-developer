# Service Worker improvements  

This article teaches you about improvements to developer tools for working with [service workers][MdnServiceWorkerApi] and the network requests that pass through each one.  The **service worker improvements** are in the **Network**, **Application**, and **Sources** tools.  The improvements simplify the following tasks.  

*   Debug based on Service Worker timelines.  
    *   The start of a request and duration of the bootstrap.  
    *   Update to Service worker registration.  
    *   The runtime of a request using the [fetch event][MdnFetchEvent] handler.  
    *   The runtime of all fetch events for loading a client.  
*   Explore the runtime details of fetch event handlers, install event handlers, and activate event handlers.  
*   Step into and out of fetch event handler with [page script information](#sources).  
    
The experiences span three different developer tools.  

1.  The [Network](#network) tool.  Choose a network request that runs through a service worker and access the corresponding timeline of the service worker in the **Timing** tool.  
1.  The [Application](#application) tool.  To debug the service workers, navigate to the **Service Workers** tool.  
1.  The [Sources](#sources) tool.  Access page script information when stepping into fetch event handlers.  
    
## Network

To access the service worker debugging features in the **Network** tool, complete one of the following actions.  

*   Access directly in the **Network** tool.  
*   Started in the **Application** tool.  
    
### Request routing  

To make request routing easier to visualize, timelines now display the service worker start-up and the `respondWith` fetch events.  To debug and visualize a network request that passed through a service worker, complete the following actions.  

1.  Choose the network request that went through a service worker.  
1.  Open the **Timing** tool.  
    
### Fetch events  

To learn more about the `respondWith` fetch events, choose the dropdown arrow to the left of the `respondWith`.  To find more details about the **Original Request** and **Response Received**, use the corresponding dropdown arrows.  

## Application

### Service worker update timeline  

The Microsoft Edge DevTools team added a timeline in the **Application** tool to reflect the update lifecycle of the service worker.  It displays the installation and activation events.  Each of the events has a corresponding dropdown arrow to give you more details.  

### Request routing and fetch events  

You may now access the service worker timelines through the **Network** tool in the console drawer.  The feature benefits performance, minimizes UI duplication, and creates a more comprehensive debugging experience.  

1.  Open the service worker you are debugging.  
1.  Choose the **Network** button to open up the [request routing experience](#network).  
1.  Use the **respondWith** dropdowns for fetch event request and response information.  

The **Network** tool displays the network requests that went through the service worker you are debugging.  The automatic filter is a way to narrow down your exploration.

## Sources

To find more stack information, set a break point in the fetch handler.  The details lead to where the resource is requested in the page script.  When the debugger pauses inside a fetch handler, a combined stack information is displayed in the panel to the right.  After that, you may move around in the stack frames.  

### Future work  

The Microsoft Edge DevTools team plans to further develop the cache detail and are investigating more ways to improve the service worker debugging experience for [Progressive Web Application][MdnProgressiveWebApps] developers.
