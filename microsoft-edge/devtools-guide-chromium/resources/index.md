# View the resource files that make up a webpage

You can view the resources that make up a web page from within several tools (or _panels_) in Microsoft Edge DevTools, including:
*  **Network** tool
*  **Sources** tool
*  **Application** tool

Resources are the files that make up a webpage.  Examples of resources include:
*  CSS files
*  JavaScript files
*  HTML files
*  Image files

*  [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn) at Mozilla.org
*  [Overview of DevTools](../../devtools-guide-chromium/overview.md)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open resource files from the Command Menu

When you know the name of a webpage's resource file that you want to inspect, the **Command Menu** in DevTools provides a fast way of finding and opening that resource.

1. In a new window or tab, go to a webpage, such as the [Accessibility-testing features demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-a11y-testing/).  (The source files for that webpage are at [MicrosoftEdge / Demos > devtools-a11y-testing](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/devtools-a11y-testing).)

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**. Or press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).

1. When DevTools has focus, press **Ctrl+P** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+P** (macOS). Or, click the **Customize and control DevTools** (![Customize icon](./index-images/customize-devtools-icon-light-theme.png)) button in DevTools and then select **Open file**.  The Command Menu opens, displaying the **Open File** list:

   ![The Command Menu, displaying the Open File list](./index-images/command-menu-empty.png)

1. If there's a greater-than (>) prompt, press **Backspace** to get to the **Open File** prompt.

1. Start typing the filename, and then press **Enter** when the correct file is highlighted in the autocomplete box, or select the file from the dropdown list:

## Browse resource files in the Network tool

In the **Network** tool, you can inspect the resource files that make up the current webpage, such as `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and image files.  To learn how to get the details for a specific resource, see [Inspect the details of the resource](../network/index.md#inspect-the-details-of-the-resource) in _Inspect network activity_.

1. In a new window or tab, go to a webpage, such as the [Inspect Network Activity Demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/).  (The source files for that webpage are at [MicrosoftEdge / Demos > network-tutorial](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/network-tutorial).)

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, select the **Network** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More Tools** (![The 'More Tools' icon](./index-images/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. Make sure the **Record network log** button in the upper left is selected (red).

1. Refresh the page.  By default, the **All** filter button is selected, so all the webpage's resource files are listed in the **Network** tool, one row per resource file:

   ![Webpage resource files listed in the Network Log, one resource file per row](./index-images/network-resources.png)

1. Select a resource to view it.  For example, select the `network-tutorial` path to display `index.html`:

   ![Inspect a resource in the Network tool](./index-images/network-response.png)

To learn more about how to show the network activity that's generated by the page resources, see [Log network activity](../network/index.md#log-network-activity) in the article  _Inspect network activity_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Browse resource files by file type by filtering in the Network tool

In the **Network** tool, when you view the list of resource files that make up the current webpage, you can filter which type of resources to list, such as only showing `.css` or `.js` files.

For example, to only display CSS files:

1. In a new window or tab, go to a webpage, such as the [Inspect Network Activity Demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/).  (The source files for that webpage are at [MicrosoftEdge / Demos > network-tutorial](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/network-tutorial).)

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, select the **Network** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More Tools** (![The 'More Tools' icon](./index-images/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. Refresh the page.  By default, the **All** filter button is selected, so all the webpage's resource files are listed in the **Network** tool.

1. Click **CSS** to filter and only display CSS files. Only the `main.css` file is listed:

   ![Filtering to only list CSS resource files in the Network Log](./index-images/network-resources-filter-css.png)

For more information, see [Filter by resource type](../network/index.md#filter-by-resource-type) in _Inspect network activity_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Show resource files in the Network tool from other tools

In various tools that list resource files for the webpage, to inspect a resource file in the **Network** tool, right-click the resource file and then select **Reveal in Network panel**.  You may need to first refresh the webpage while the **Network** tool is open.

For example, to go from the **Page** tab's resource list in the **Sources** tool to the **Network** tool:

1. In a new window or tab, go to a webpage, such as the [Inspect Network Activity Demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/network-tutorial/).  (The source files for that webpage are at [MicrosoftEdge / Demos > network-tutorial](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/network-tutorial).)

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, select the **Network** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More Tools** (![More Tools icon](./index-images/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. Press **Ctrl+R** to refresh the page.  The received resource files that make up the webpage are now added as rows in the **Network** tab.  The **network-tutorial/** folder row represents the HTML page - in this case, [index.html](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/network-tutoriql).

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, click the **Sources** tab.

1. In the **Page** tab in the upper left, right-click a resource file, and then select **Reveal in Network panel**:

   ![The 'Reveal in Network panel' right-click menuitem on a resource file in the Page tab of the Sources tool](./index-images/sources-page-reveal-in-network-panel.png)

   If the **Reveal in Network panel** menuitem isn't listed, go to the **Network** tool, make sure the **Record network log** button in the upper left is selected (red), and then refresh the page.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Browse resource files by folder in the Page tab of the Sources tool

You can use the **Sources** tool to view the webpage's resource files organized by directory, as follows:

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, select the **Sources** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More tools** (![More tools icon](./index-images/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. In the **Navigator** pane in the upper left, select the **Page** tab.

1. By default, resource files are grouped by folder.  If the resources are all listed alphabetically by file name instead, click the **More options** (![More options icon](./index-images/more-options-icon.png)) button to the right of the **Page** tab, and then select **Group by folder**:

   ![The webpage's resource files grouped by folder in the Page tab of the Sources tool](./index-images/sources-page-empty.png)

    The **Page** tab contains various node types, including:

    | Page item | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `top` | The main document _browsing context_, such as a browser tab, a browser window, or a frame. See [Browsing context](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context) or [\<iframe\>: The Inline Frame element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). |
    | `microsoftedge.github.io` | The domain.  All resources nested under it come from that domain.  For example, the full URL of the `buttons.js` file is [https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-a11y-testing/buttons.js](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-a11y-testing/buttons.js). |
    | `Demos/devtools-a11y-testing`, `css`, `photos` | Directories. |
    | `devtools-a11y-testing/` | The main HTML document. |
    | `buttons.js` | A script to handle button presses on the page. |

1. Select a resource file to view it in the Editor of the **Sources** tool:

   ![Viewing a resource file in the Editor of the Sources tool](./index-images/sources-page-resource.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Browse resource files sorted by filename in the Page tab of the Sources tool

By default, the **Page** tab in the **Sources** tool groups resource files by folder.  To instead display all the resource files for each domain grouped together in a single alphabetized list:

1. In a new window or tab, go to a webpage, such as the [Accessibility-testing features demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/devtools-a11y-testing/).  (The source files for that webpage are at [MicrosoftEdge / Demos > devtools-a11y-testing](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/devtools-a11y-testing).)

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, select the **Sources** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More tools** (![The More tools icon](./index-images/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. In the **Navigator** pane in the upper left, select the **Page** tab.

1. Click **More options** (![More options icon](./index-images/more-options-icon.png)) and then clear the **Group by folder** option:

   ![The Group by folder option in the Page tab of the Sources tool](./index-images/sources-page-resource-group-by-folder.png)

   All the resource files for each domain (such as **Top**) are grouped together in a single alphabetized list:

   ![The Page tab in the Sources tool when the 'Group by folder' option is cleared](./index-images/sources-page-resources-empty-not-grouped-by-folder.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Browse resource files by file type in the Frames tree in the Application tool

One way to view webpage resources grouped by file type is by using the **Frames** tree in the **Application** tool:

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows, Linux) or **Command+Option+I** (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the **Activity Bar**, select the **Application** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More Tools** (![The More Tools icon](./index-images/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

   The **Application** tool opens and by default shows the **Manifest** pane first:
   
   ![The Application tool](./index-images/application-mainfest.png)

1. Scroll down to the **Frames** pane and then expand the folder that you're interested in:

   ![The Frames tree in the Application tool](./index-images/application-mainfest-frames-expanded.png)

1. Select a resource to view it in the **Application** tool:

   ![Viewing a resource in the Application tool](./index-images/application-mainfest-expanded-resources.png)
