# Handling Windows Runtime Events in JavaScript
Windows Runtime events are not represented in the same way in JavaScript as they are in C++ or the .NET Framework. They are not class properties, but rather are represented as (lowercased) string identifiers that are passed to the class's `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods. For example, you can add an event handler for the [Geolocator.PositionChanged](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.devices.geolocation.geolocator.positionchanged.aspx) event by passing the string "positionchanged" to the `Geolocator.addEventListener` method:  
  
```JavaScript  
var locator = new Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geolocator();  
locator.addEventListener(  
    "positionchanged",   
     function (ev) {  
        console.log("Got event");  
    });  
```  
  
 You can also set the `locator.onpositionchanged` property:  
  
```JavaScript  
locator.onpositionchanged =    
    function (ev) {  
        console.log("Got event");  
    };  
```  
  
Another difference between .NET/C++ and JavaScript is the number of parameters taken by an event handler. In .NET/C++, a handler takes two: the event sender, and the event data. In JavaScript, the two are bundled as a single `Event` object. In the following example, the `ev` parameter contains both the sender of the event (the `target` property) and the event data properties (here, just `position`). The event data properties are the ones that are documented for each event.
  
```JavaScript  
function (ev) {  
    console.log("Sender: " + ev.target);  
    console.log("Position: " +  
        ev.position.latitude + "," +  
        ev.position.longitude);  
};  
```
