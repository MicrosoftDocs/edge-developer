# Windows Runtime DateTime and TimeSpan Representations  

The JavaScript representation of dates and times is different from the Windows Runtime version.  The Windows Runtime [DateTime][UwpWindowsFoundationDatetime] structure is represented in JavaScript as a [Date][MDNDate] that has a backing store that matches the `DateTime` data \(and has a different range and precision from the JavaScript `Date`\).  If you modify this custom `Date` object, it becomes a standard JavaScript `Date` and loses precision.  JavaScript `Date` values can be passed to a Windows Runtime `DateTime` and will be range-checked, which might result in marshaling exceptions.  

 The Windows Runtime [TimeSpan][UwpWindowsFoundationTimespan] structure is converted to milliseconds and returned as a JavaScript number.
