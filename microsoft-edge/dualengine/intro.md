# Introduction to the Microsoft DualEngine API

Use the Microsoft DualEngine API to embed and control an Internet Explorer instance within your app.  The DualEngine API provides a browsing experience that's equivalent to a normal Internet Explorer tab, to provide increased compatibility with legacy websites.

The DualEngine API differs from similar APIs like the Web Browser Control, and requires distinct development work.
