# Accessibility - DevTools (EdgeHTML)  

View the accessible properties assigned to the selected element. Hover over any of the property names for a description of how it's used by assistive technologies. You can also right-click any property to copy its value to the clipboard.

It's useful to open the [Accessibility tree](#accessibility-tree) to navigate around your page as a screen reader would, and then use the **Accessibility** pane to inspect details about accessibility properties of interest.

## Accessibility tree  

The **Accessibility tree** pane shows the structure of your page as it would appear to an assistive technology, such as the [Windows Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/help/22798/windows-10-narrator-get-started) screen reader.

Clicking on a node in the tree view will also select it in the [**HTML tree**](../elements.md#html-tree-view), and vice versa. Selecting an accessible element from either the *HTML* or *Accessibility* tree views will also populate further accessibility property details in the **Accessibility** tool pane.
