# Storage

Use the **Storage** panel to inspect and manage various locally cached data, including:

 - [Web storage](#local-and-session-storage-managers) (*Local* and *Session* storage) key/values pairs
 - [Indexed DB](#indexeddb-manager) structured data
 - [Cookies](#cookies-list) for the domain
 - [Cache](#cache-manager) (request/response pairs) for service worker debugging

Expand any of those categories and click on a child entry to open its resource manager tab.

## Local and Session storage managers

Use the *Local Storage manager* and *Session Storage manager* to inspect and manage the web storage for  your page. 

The **Local Storage** and **Session Storage** folders inside the Storage panel's [*Resource picker*](./debugger.md#resource-picker) display a list of origins for the page. Selecting one of these frames opens up an editable table of the current key/value pairs set via [Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) or [Window.sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), respectively (and/or set directly from the  DevTools [Storage list](#storage-list)).

From the *Local Storage* and *Session Storage* tabs you can:

 - **Refresh** (`Ctrl+F5`) the [storage list](#cookies-list) to see the current set of key/values pairs for the given domain. (The list does not auto-refresh upon script updates.)
 - **Simulate reaching the storage limit** for Microsoft Edge web storage. Each domain and subdomain has its own storage area, however there is a combined limit:
    - **Subdomains:** up to 5 MBs of space
    - **Domains:** up to 10 MBs of space
    - **Total for all domains:** up to 50 MBs of space

   Session storage is cleared as soon as the last browser tab referencing its origin is closed. Local storage entries persist indefinitely until cleared programmatically by the page or manually by the user:

   **Settings** > **Clear browsing data** > **Cookies and saved website data**

### Storage list

From the *Storage list* table you can:

 - **Inspect and sort** your key/value pairs by clicking on either column name in the table.
 - **Edit** the *Key* and *Value* of an existing entry by clicking in the cell.
 - **Delete** (`Del`) an entry from the right-click context menu option, *Delete item*.
 - **Add** a new key/value pair by clicking on the empty row at the bottom of the table.


### Shortcuts

| Action              | Shortcut      |
|:--------------------|:--------------|
| Refresh             | `Ctrl` + `F5` |
| Delete item         | `Del`         |
| Copy selected items | `Ctrl` + `C`  |
| Select all          | `Ctrl` + `A`  |


## IndexedDB manager

Use the **IndexedDB** tab to inspect and manage the structured data stored locally on a client machine. Specifically, you can inspect/sort and refresh your object stores and indices, and also delete individual key-value entries.

> [!TIP]
> You can use our [Audio Mixer](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/testdrive/demos/audiomixer/) demo to test drive the *IndexedDB manager* in Microsoft Edge DevTools.

To delete all the IndexedDB data stored for the current user in Microsoft Edge, use the Microsoft Edge *Settings* menu:

**...** > **Settings** > **Clear browsing data** > **Cookies and saved website data**

The **IndexedDB** folder inside the Debugger's [*Resource picker*](./debugger.md#resource-picker) displays a list of origins from the resources loaded by the page. Any IndexedDB (IDB) databases will be listed under the origin, along with their object stores. 

![DevTools IndexedDB manager](./media/storage_indexeddb.png)

### IndexedDB Toolbar

From the *IndexedDB* toolbar you can:

 - **Refresh** (`Ctrl+F5`) to see the current entries in the object store or index of your database. The IndexedDB manager does not auto-refresh when changes are made to your database.

### Object store entries list

From the *Object store* or *Index* table you can:

 - **Inspect and sort** your key-value pairs by clicking on any column name in the table.
 - **Refresh** (`Ctrl+F5`)
 - **Delete item** (`Del`) to remove the selected entry in your object store or index. You can also do this from the right-click [context menu](#context-menu) option, *Delete item*.
 - **Copy selected items** (`Ctrl+C`) to copy the selected item to your clipboard. You can also do this from the right-click [context menu](#context-menu) option, *Copy selected item*.
 - **Select all** (`Ctrl+A`) to select all the entries in your object store or index. You can also do this from the right-click [context menu](#context-menu) option, *Select all*.

The columns of the *Object store* or *Index* table are sortable:

Column | Description
:------------ | :-------------
Key | Name of the key-value pair (same as *Primary Key*) when iterating over an object store; Name of the index key (cursor's current key) when iterating over an index
Primary Key | Name of the key-value pair (see *MDN web docs* for more on IDB [keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB#Structuring_the_database))
Value | Value of the key-value pair

Check out *MDN web docs* for more on [IndexedDB concepts and usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

### Context menu

In addition to the [*IndexedDB* toolbar](#indexeddb-toolbar), you can also manage your data in object stores or indices from the right-click **Context menu** and/or the keyboard [shortcuts](#shortcuts).

### Shortcuts

Action | Shortcut
:------------ | :-------------
Refresh | `Ctrl` + `F5`
Delete key-value pair | `Del`
Copy selected items | `Ctrl` + `C`
Select all | `Ctrl` + `A`

## Cookies manager

Use the *Cookies manager* to inspect and manage the cookies for the given domain. 

The **Cookies** folder inside the Debugger's [*Resource picker*](./debugger.md#resource-picker) displays a list of origins from the resources loaded by the page. Selecting one of these frames opens up a table representing the current cookies set by either [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) header or via script with [Document.cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie).

![DevTools Cookies manager](./media/storage_cookies.png)

From the *Cookies* tab toolbar you can:

 - **Refresh** (`Ctrl+F5`) the [Cookies list](#cookies-list) to see the current set of cookies for the given domain. (The list does not auto-refresh.)
 - **Delete all cookies** (`Ctrl+Shift+Del`) (session and permanent) for the path of the current page.
 - **Delete all session cookies** (`Ctrl+Del`) for the path of the current page.

To completely clear your *Cookies list*, you might need to **Clear all cookies for the domain** from the [**Network**](./network.md#toolbar) panel toolbar.

### Cookies list

From the *Cookies list* table you can:

 - **Inspect and sort** your cookies by clicking on any column name in the table.
 - **Edit** the *Name* and *Value* of an existing cookie by clicking in the cell.
 - **Delete** (`Del`) a cookie from the right-click [context menu](#context-menu) option, *Delete cookie*.
 - **Add** a new session cookie for the given *Domain/Path* by clicking on the empty row at the bottom of the table. This only works for session cookies; permanent cookies (with specific expiry dates) must be set with traditional methods. The *Domain* and *Path* values are auto-filled according to the location of the page.

The columns of the *Cookies list* are sortable:

Column | Description
:------------ | :-------------
Name | Name of the cookie
Value | Value of the cookie
Domain | Host name of the cookie (may be empty)
Path | URL path for the cookie (may be empty)
Expires | Maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. If no `Expires` or `Max-Age` was set, the entry is considered a *Session* cookie.
HTTP only | Indicates if the cookie was set with `HttpOnly` directive, indicating that it is inaccessible from JavaScript
Secure | Indicates if the cookie was set with the `Secure` directive, indicating it will only be sent to the server from a request using SSL and the HTTPS protocol.

See the **MDN web docs** [Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) reference for further details on cookie properties.

### Context menu

In addition to the *Cookies* tab [toolbar](#cookies-manager), you can also manage your cookies from the right-click **Context menu** and/or the keyboard [shortcuts](#shortcuts).
