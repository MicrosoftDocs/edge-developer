# Get started using the DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code

These tutorials walk you through several ways of opening and closing DevTools, and also get you started with modifying CSS and debugging JavaScript.

*  Right-click an `.html` file for **Demo To Do** in the **Explorer** of Visual Studio Code, without needing to run a web server.  See [Get started by right-clicking an HTML file](./get-started-right-click-html.md).

*  Click the **Launch Instance** button, to experiment with the demo **Success** webpage.  See [Get started by clicking the Launch Instance button](./get-started-launch-instance.md).

*  Click the **Launch Project** button, to run **Demo To Do** on a localhost web server and store the URL for the webpage in `launch.json`.  See [Get started by clicking the Launch Project button](./get-started-launch-project.md).
