# DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code
<!-- this is an aux jump page, that appears in the IDE TOC bucket rather than in the DevTools extension bucket -->

The Microsoft Edge DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code lets you use the Microsoft Edge Browser and Developer Tools to develop webpages and web apps right from within the Visual Studio Code IDE.

Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, so it's a great tool for web developers.  Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that's available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

See [Microsoft Edge DevTools extension for Visual Studio Code](../microsoft-edge-devtools-extension.md).
