# Microsoft Edge IDE integration

Various features of Microsoft tools provide integration of development using Microsoft Edge, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio, to develop your products, webpages, and web apps that use and work with full integration in Microsoft Edge.

## Visual Studio Code for web development

Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, so it's a great tool for web developers.  Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that's available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

With the **Microsoft Edge DevTools** extension for Visual Studio Code, you can use the **Elements** tool of the Microsoft Edge browser within Visual Studio Code.  Use the Elements tool to:

*  Attach to an instance or launch an instance of Microsoft Edge.
*  Display the runtime HTML structure.
*  Update the layout.
*  Fix styling issues.

See [Visual Studio Code for web development](index.md).

## Visual Studio for web development

Microsoft [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) is an integrated development environment (IDE).   Use it to edit, debug, build, and publish your web apps.  It's a feature-rich program that can be used for many aspects of your web development.

In addition to the standard editor and debugger that most IDEs provide, Visual Studio includes features to ease your development process, including:

*   Compilers.
*   Code completion tools.
*   Graphical designers.
*   And many more features.
