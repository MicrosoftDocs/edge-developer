Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, so it's a great tool for web developers.  Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that's available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

With the **Microsoft Edge DevTools** extension for Visual Studio Code, you can use the **Elements** tool of the Microsoft Edge browser within Visual Studio Code.  Use the Elements tool to:

*  Attach to an instance or launch an instance of Microsoft Edge.
*  Display the runtime HTML structure.
*  Update the layout.
*  Fix styling issues.
