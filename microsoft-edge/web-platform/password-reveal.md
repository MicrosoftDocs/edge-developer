# Customize the password reveal button

The `password` input type in Microsoft Edge includes a **password reveal** control.  To make sure that the password is entered correctly, a user can click the **password reveal** button or press `Alt`+`F8`, to show the characters in the password field.

A **password** field with dots hiding the characters entered by a user.  The **password reveal** button appears to the right of the **password** field.  The eye-shaped icon appears next to the dots that hide the password text:

:::image type="complex" source="./media/mdn-demo-password-reveal-off.msft.png" alt-text="The eye-shaped icon appears next to the dots that hide the password text" lightbox="./media/mdn-demo-password-reveal-off.msft.png":::

Toggle the **password reveal** button to change the eye icon to an eye icon with a slash through it, and to reveal the original password text.  The eye-shaped icon has a slash on it and the original password text is displayed:

:::image type="complex" source="./media/mdn-demo-password-reveal-on.msft.png" alt-text="The The eye-shaped icon has a slash on it and the original password text is displayed" lightbox="./media/mdn-demo-password-reveal-on.msft.png":::

By default, the **password reveal** button inserts into the Shadow DOM of all HTML `input` elements with the `type` set to `"password"`.  Starting with Microsoft Edge Version 87, users or [enterprises](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordrevealenabled) may disable this feature globally.  You, web designers and developers, should expect most Microsoft Edge users to have the default experience.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Remove the password reveal control

You may completely remove the **password reveal** button by targeting the `::-ms-reveal` pseudo element.

```css
::-ms-reveal {
    display: none;
}
```

However, you should consider taking advantage of the **password reveal** button.  The native **password reveal** button has important [security measures](#visibility-of-the-control) built into the behavior.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Customize the control style

Instead of fully removing the control, you may instead modify the styling of the **password reveal** button to better match the visual language of the website.  The following snippet provides an example of such styling.

```css
::-ms-reveal {
    border: 1px solid transparent;
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 0 0 3px currentColor;
}
```

Keep the following things in mind when you style the **password reveal** button.

*   The eye icon implements as a background image.  To add a background color to the **password reveal** button, use the CSS `background-color` property instead of the `background` shorthand property.
*   You may adjust the size and scale of the **password reveal** button.

    > [!NOTE]
    >The browser hides any overflow outside of the bounds of the password input control.

*   Currently, no state selectors are available to style the toggled state of the **password reveal** button.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Visibility of the control

The **password reveal** button is unavailable until the user enters text into the **password** field.  To help keep the user's password entry secure, the browser suppresses the button in the following scenarios.

*   If focus moves away from the **password** field, the browser removes the **password reveal** button.
*   If scripts modify the **password** field, the browser removes the **password reveal** button.

If the **password reveal** button is removed, the user must delete the contents of the **password** field before the **password reveal** button displays again. This behavior prevents someone from making a minor adjustment to display the password, should the user step away from an unlocked device.

The **password reveal** button is unavailable if the **password** field autofills using the password manager.
