<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS carousel widget: `::column` pseudo-element

The `::column` CSS pseudo-element represents the individual columns in a multi-column container.

The container can be styled with a limited amount of CSS properties.

The container can be snapped to by its scrolling container, by using `::scroll-marker` pseudo-elements.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS carousel widget: `::scroll-marker` and `::scroll-marker-groups` pseudo-elements

The `::scroll-marker` and `::scroll-markers-group` pseudo-elements allow creating a set of focusable markers within a scroll container.

The set of focusable markers is used to snap the scroll container to specific positions.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS carousel widget: `::scroll-button()` pseudo-element

The `::scroll-button()` pseudo-element allows creating scroll buttons as pseudo-elements of a scroll container.

The scroll buttons are used to scroll the container in the direction of the button, when the scroll buttons are clicked.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Nested pseudo-elements styling

Pseudo-elements that are nested inside other pseudo-elements can now be styled, by using `::before::marker` and `::after::marker`.

`::column::scroll-marker` is not yet supported.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `interactivity` property

The CSS `interactivity` property specifies whether an element and its flat tree descendants (including text runs) are inert or not.

Making an element inert affects:
* Whether the element can be focused, edited, selected, and searchable by Find-in-page.
* Whether the element is visible in the accessibility tree.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS logical overflow properties

The `overflow-inline` and `overflow-block` CSS properties allow setting overflow in inline and block direction relative to the writing-mode.

* In horizontal writing-mode, `overflow-inline` maps to `overflow-x`.
* In vertical writing-mode, `overflow-inline` maps to `overflow-y`.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `abs()` and `sign()` functions

The `abs(A)` function returns the absolute value of _A_, as the same type as the input.  The return type is a `<number>`.

The `sign(A)` function returns:
* `-1` if the numeric value of _A_ is negative.
* `+1` if the numeric value of _A_ is positive.
* `0` otherwise.

The return type is a `<number>`.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS anchor positioning: remembered scroll offset

When a positioned element has a default anchor, and is tethered to this anchor at one edge, and against the original containing block at the other edge, the scroll offset will be taken into account when sizing the element.

Taking the scroll offset into account when sizing the element enables using all visible space for the anchored element (by using `position-area`) when the document is scrolled at a given scroll offset.

In order to avoid resizing the element every time the document is scrolled, the "remembered scroll offset" concept is used, rather than always using the current scroll offset.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `shape()` function

The `shape()` CSS function allows using free-form and responsive shapes in the `clip-path` property.

You can define a series of verbs, equivalent to the verbs in the `path()` function.

You can use responsive units, such as `%` or `vw`.

You can use CSS values, such as custom properties.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `progress()` functions

The `progress()`, `media-progress()`, and `container-progress()` functions represent the proportional distance of a given value (the progress value) from one value (the progress start value) to another value (the progress end value).

* `progress()` allows drawing a progress ratio from math functions.
* `media-progress()` allows drawing a progress ratio from media features.
* `container-progress()` allows drawing a progress ratio from container features.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### `safe-area-max-inset-*` variables

The `safe-area-max-inset-top`, `safe-area-max-inset-right`, `safe-area-max-inset-bottom`, and `safe-area-max-inset-left` environment variables are tied to the safe area inset variables, but represent the maximum possible safe area.

Using the maximum possible safe area is useful to avoid updating the layout of a page when the safe area inset value grows.


<!-- ---------- -->
#### HTML features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `command` and `commandfor` HTML attributes

The `command` and `commandfor` HTML attributes for `<button>` elements allow you to assign behavior to buttons in an accessible and declarative way, while reducing how often a JavaScript page must be used to provide interactivity.

When clicked, touched, or activated via a keypress, a button with the `commandfor` and `command` attributes dispatches a `CommandEvent` on the element that's referenced by `commandfor`, with some default behaviors, such as opening dialogs and popovers.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Link `rel=facilitated-payment` to support push payments

The `<link rel="facilitated-payment" href="...">` element acts as a hint that the browser uses to notify registered payment clients about a pending push payment.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support for `rel` and `relList` attributes in SVG `<a>` elements

The SVGAElement interface in SVG 2.0 allows manipulating SVG `<a>` elements, which are similar to HTML anchor elements.  This change adds support for the `rel` and `relList` attributes, to enhance security and privacy for your webpages.

This approach aligns with how HTML anchor elements work, and ensures consistency and ease of use across SVG and HTML.


<!-- ---------- -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add MediaStreamTrack support to the Web Speech API

The Web Speech API is a web standard API that allows you to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into your webpages.

The Web Speech API uses the user's default microphone as the default audio input.  MediaStreamTrack support allows a website to use the Web Speech API to caption other sources of audio, including remote audio tracks.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Create service worker client and inherit service worker controller for iframe with `srcdoc`

A service worker client is now created for iframes that use the `srcdoc` attribute. The created service worker client inherits from the service worker of the iframe's parent.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Dispatching click events to captured pointer

If a pointer is captured while the `pointerup` event is being dispatched, the `click` event is dispatched to the captured target, instead of being dispatched to the nearest common ancestor of `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Float16Array

The `Float16Array` typed array is now supported.  Number values are rounded to half-precision float-point format (IEEE FP16) when writing into a `Float16Array` instance.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `sourceElement` property for `NavigateEvent`

When a page navigation is initiated by an element, such as when the user clicks a link or submits a form, the resulting `NavigateEvent` now has a `sourceElement` property that points to the initiating element.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### PerformanceNavigationTiming API NotRestoredReasons name change

The NotRestoredReasons API is part of the PerformanceNavigationTiming API. This change updates the names of the reasons so that they match the specification.

List of changes:

| Old name | New name |
| --- | --- |
| `extension-messaging`, `pending-permission-request`, `not-main-frame`, `frame-navigating`, `timeout`, `cookie-disabled`, `cookie-removed`, `printing`, `web-database`, `injected-javascript`, and `injected-stylesheet` | `masked` |
| `response-method-not-get` | `request-method-not-get` |
| `serviceworker-version-activation` | `serviceworker-version-activated` |
| `serviceworker-added-after-bfcache` | `serviceworker-added` |
| `serviceworker-unregistration` | `serviceworker-unregistered` |
| `unload-handler` | `unload-listener` |
| `session-restored` | `null` |


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Observable API

Observables are a popular reactive-programming paradigm to handle an asynchronous stream of push-based events.  Observables can be thought of as Promises but for multiple events. Observables let you write more linear and declarative-style code and avoid nested callbacks.  That is, Observables allow ergonomic event handling, by providing an `Observable` object that represents the asynchronous flow of events.

You can "subscribe" to this object to receive events as they come in, and call any of its operators to declaratively describe the flow of transformations through which events go.  This is in contrast with the _imperative_ version, which often requires complicated nesting with approaches such as `addEventListener()`.

See the [W3C Observable specification](https://wicg.github.io/observable/).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Service worker client URL now ignores `history.pushState` changes

The `Client.url` property of a service worker, which is the URL of the initial HTML document, now ignores changes that are made by the `history.pushState()` method and other similar history APIs.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Timestamps for RTC Encoded Frames

The following timestamps are now exposed:

* Capture timestamp: The timestamp when a frame was originally captured.
* Receive timestamp: The timestamp when a frame was received.

These timestamps are present in WebRTC-encoded frames that are transmitted via `RTCPeerConnection`.

This change allows video conferencing applications which use WebRTC to implement latency measurements to better understand performance.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### fetchLater API

`fetchLater()` is a JavaScript API to send a deferred fetch request.  After the deferred fetch request has been sent, a deferred request is queued by the browser in a _pending_ state.

The deferred fetch request is then invoked by the earliest of the following conditions:
* When the document is destroyed.
* After a user-specified time.
* When the browser decides it's time to send the request.

The API returns a `FetchLaterResult` that contains the `activated` boolean field.  The `activated` boolean field can be updated to tell whether the deferred request has been sent.  After the deferred request has been successfully sent, the response is ignored by the browser, including the webpage's body and headers.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### highlightsFromPoint API

The `highlightsFromPoint()` API enables your webpages to interact with CSS Custom Highlights, by detecting which highlights exist at a specific point within a document.

Getting highlights from a point can be used by a web app to manage user interactions with custom highlights, such as:
* Responding to a hover event on a highlighted region, to trigger a custom tooltip.
* Responding to a user click on a highlighted region, to trigger a right-click menu (context menu).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove `navigator.xr.supportsSession` method

The deprecated `navigator.xr.supportsSession` property has been removed from the WebXR API.

In the WebXR specification in 2019, the `navigator.xr.supportsSession` property was marked as deprecated, and was replaced by the `navigator.xr.isSessionSupported()` method.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove WebGPU limit `maxInterStageShaderComponents`

The `maxInterStageShaderComponents` limit is now removed, due to:

* Redundancy with `maxInterStageShaderVariables`, which already serves a similar purpose: controlling the amount of data that's passed between shader stages.

* Minor discrepancies: Although there are slight differences in how the two limits are calculated, these differences are minor, and can be effectively managed within the `maxInterStageShaderVariables` limit.

* Simplification: Removing `maxInterStageShaderComponents` streamlines the shader interface, and reduces complexity of using the interface.  Instead of managing two separate limits (that both apply simultaneously, but with subtle differences), you can just concentrate on the more appropriately named and comprehensive `maxInterStageShaderVariables`.
