<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## CSS/SVG/Web API features



<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Add presentationTime/paintTime to performance entries

Expose "paintTime" and "presentationTime" in element timing, LCP, long animation frames, and paint timing.

"paintTime" means the time when the rendering phase ended and the browser started the paint phase.
"presentationTime" means the time when the "pixels reached the screen", which is somewhat implementation-defined.

This feature entry omits event timing, which would be done separately.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS letter-spacing and word-spacing: percentage values

Enables percentage values for the letter-spacing and word-spacing CSS property, as defined in the CSS Text Module Level 4 spec. Percentage values are calculated relative to the advance measure of the space character (U+0020). This gives developers more robust and flexible control over typography, particularly in responsive designs where text spacing needs to adapt to different viewports and font sizes.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Cache sharing for extremely-pervasive resources

For a small number (hundreds) of hand-curated static third-party script, stylesheet and compression-dictionary resources that are used on a large portion of the web, Chrome will use a single-keyed HTTP cache to store those resources. 

This helps users and site owners with faster performance for those resources that are very widely used while maintaining the privacy protections of the partitioned disk cache.

This feature targets the resources that most users are likely to see multiple times across multiple sites in any given browsing session. They are usually not in the critical path of the page loading and may not impact the common performance metrics but they are still important for the healthy operation of the web.

The list of candidate scripts is curated from the HTTP Archive dataset.

This includes site-independent things like common analytics scripts, social media embeds, video player embeds, captcha providers and ads libraries. It allows for code that uses versioned URLs as long as the versioning is not a manual process by embedders and that the same version is sent to everybody at a given point in time with the same contents.

This does not include things like common Javascript libraries where they are commonly self-hosted or where the URL references a specific version of the library and it is up to site owners to manually select a version.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Clipboardchange event - Sticky activation / Permission check

Require sticky user activation or clipboard-read permission to fire `clipboardchange` events, preventing unauthorized clipboard monitoring.

This is as per the spec defined here - https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#clipboard-event-clipboardchange

Reason for PSA - Clipboardchange event is relatively new (144) and this has minimal web facing change. It is expected that in most cases sticky activation / clipboard-read permission would already be present where clipboard monitoring is done (like remote desktop clients)

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Column wrapping for multicol

Add support for the `column-wrap` and `column-height` CSS properties, from multicol Level 2. 

https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-2/#cwr
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-2/#ch

This allows for vertical column layout, or even 2D column layout. Columns can have an explicit constrained height, apart from being derived from the content-box height of the multicol container, and wrap to a new row of columns when all columns have been filled for one row, rather than creating overflowing columns in the inline direction.

See also:
* []()


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Cookie Store API `maxAge` attribute

Allows callers to specify a `maxAge` when setting a cookie with the Cookie Store API.

Cookie expiry time is already configurable using the `expires` attribute, but `maxAge` provides a more idiomatic option and aligns the Cookie Store API with the options provided by `document.cookie` and the `Set-Cookie` HTTP Header.  

See also:
* []()


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Customizable select listbox

This feature extends customizable select support to the listbox rendering mode, including single-select and multi-select in listbox mode.

The listbox rendering mode means that the select element is rendered in-flow or in the page rather than with a separate button and popup. Listbox rendering mode is opted into across platforms via the multiple or size attributes, like <select multiple> or <select size=4>. When the appearance:base-select CSS property is applied to the select element with these attributes, it will now have improved rendering and input behavior.

This feature does not support customizable select for the multi-select popup, which will come later. The following attributes must be set in order to get a multi-select popup: <select multiple size=1>.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Device Bound Session Credentials

A way for websites to securely bind a session to a single device.

It will let servers have a session be securely bound to a device. The browser will renew the session periodically as requested by the server, with proof of possession of a private key.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Enable monochrome emoji rendering in forced colors mode.

This change updates Chromium’s emoji rendering behavior in Forced Colors Mode. During computed-value resolution, emoji whose font-variant-emoji value computes to normal or unicode are rendered using their monochrome glyphs when available.

Chromium will therefore suppress color emoji rendering, which ensures emojis fully participate in the Forced Colors Mode pipeline and respect system high-contrast colors. Behavior outside forced colors mode is unchanged.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Enabling Web Applications to understand bimodal performance timings

Web applications may suffer from bimodal distribution in page load performance due to factors outside of the application’s control. For example, when a user agent first launches in a "cold start" scenario, it must perform many expensive initialization tasks that compete for system resources. Browser extensions can also affect performance, since some extensions run additional code on every page you visit, increasing CPU usage and slowing response times. Likewise, when a machine is already busy with intensive tasks, web pages may load more slowly as a result.

In these scenarios, content the web app attempts to load will be in competition with other work happening on the system. This makes it difficult to detect if performance issues exist within web applications themselves, or because of external factors.

Teams we have worked with have been surprised at the difference between real-world dashboard metrics and what they observe in page profiling tools. Without more information, it is challenging for developers to understand if (and when) their applications may be misbehaving or are simply being loaded in a contended period. 

A new ‘confidence’ field on the PerformanceNavigationTiming object will enable developers to discern if the navigation timings are representative for their web application.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Expose &#39;onanimationcancel&#39; event to GlobalEventHandlers

The CSS Animations Level 1 extends [1] the GlobalEventsHandler Interface defined in the HTML spec [2], declaring 4 new event handlers: onanimationstart, onanimationiteration, onanimationend and onanimationcancel. 
Only the 'onanimationcancel' event handler has been missing from the GobalEventsHandler IDL. 

[1]https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations/#interface-globaleventhandlers
[2]https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#globaleventhandlers

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Expose rtpTimestamp from WebRTC video frames via VideoFrame.metadata()

Adds a VideoFrame.metadata() method that returns a dictionary containing the rtpTimestamp field, if the underlying VideoFrame has this field in its native metadata. An empty dictionary is returned otherwise. Only video frames originating from WebRTC sources will have the rtpTimestamp metadata attached.

Additional metadata fields are already present in the native implementation and may be exposed to JavaScript over time, as outlined in the proposed spec:
https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata

* []()


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Focus&#39;s focusVisible option

When calling the `focus()` method, developers can supply a `focusVisible` boolean in the FocusOptions dictionary. When true, a focus ring will always be painted around the newly-focused element and it will match the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class. When false, the focus ring will not be painted and `:focus-visible` will not match. When missing, the user agent make its own determination as to whether the focus ring should be painted, and the :focus-visible pseudo-class matches accordingly.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### IDNA ContextJ rules

IDNA is the mechanism for non-ASCII characters in domain names, encoding a URL like http://네이버.한국/ as http://xn--950bt9s8xi.xn--3e0b707e/ (a redirect to naver.com).

The processing is defined by https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#Processing and is invoked by https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#idna.

The URL spec sets the CheckJoiners flag, which enables the ContextJ rules in IDNA2008:
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892.html#appendix-A.1
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892.html#appendix-A.2

This disallows ZWNJ (U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and ZWJ (U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER) in most places in URLs.

The implementation is to simply pass the UIDNA_CHECK_CONTEXTJ option to ICU, where this rule is implemented:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/icu/source/common/uts46.cpp;l=1137-1204;drc=8a1988938d4298fbe8fb499b1a59fe4b04a21b15

This would fix over 200 subtests in WPT relating to IDNA, which already pass in Firefox and Safari:
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6990929
https://wpt.fyi/results/url/IdnaTestV2.window.html

All of the IdnaTestV2 cases that would regress from shipping ICU 77 (https://chromestatus.com/feature/5143313833000960) would also be fixed again by this change.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### InputEvent types for deletion commands on non-collapsed selections

Reports accurate inputType values for deletion keyboard shortcuts on selected text. When deletion commands like Ctrl+Backspace or Ctrl+Delete are used with selected text in contenteditable elements, the beforeinput and input events now report deleteContentBackward or deleteContentForward instead of deleteWordBackward or deleteWordForward. This enables web developers to correctly understand what editing operation occurred and implement reliable undo/redo or custom editing behaviors.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Navigation API: expose destination in navigation.transition

Currently NavigationTransition has a "from" property, exposing the old URL of the navigation. Exposing "to" (a NavigationDestination) completes this. It is especially useful when using precommit handlers, as during precommit the current URL has not yet switched to the destination.

Note that navigation.transition is only exposed for intercepted navigations - which means same-origin document-initiated navigations.

* []()


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Origin API

The origin is a fundamental component of the web’s implementation, essential to both the security and privacy boundaries which user agents maintain. The concept is well-defined between HTML and URL, along with widely-used adjacent concepts like "site".

Origins, however, are not directly exposed to web developers. Though there are various origin getters on various objects, each of those returns the ASCII serialization of an origin, not the origin itself. This has a few negative implications. Practically, developers attempting to do same-origin or same-site comparisons when handling serialized origins often get things wrong in ways that lead to vulnerabilities. Philosophically, it seems like a missing security primitive that developers struggle to polyfill accurately.

We can address this gap in the platform by introducing an Origin object that encapsulates the origin concept, and provides helpful methods for comparison, serialization, parsing, and etc.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Preserving dropEffect Values from dragover to drop Events

The HTML5 Drag and Drop API allows web applications to handle drag-and-drop operations through a series of events: `dragstart`, `dragenter`, `dragover`, `dragleave`, `drop`, and `dragend`. During these events, the [`dataTransfer.dropEffect`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html#dom-datatransfer-dropeffect) property indicates which operation (copy, move, link, or none) should be performed. According to the [HTML5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html#dndevents), the `dropEffect` value set by web applications during the last `dragover` event should be preserved and available in the subsequent `drop` event.

However, Chromium-based browsers were overwriting the web application's `dropEffect` value with the browser's own negotiated operation before the `drop` event fired, breaking specification compliance and limiting developer control over drag-and-drop behavior.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Refine border-radius shadow edge computation for high border-radius

This improvement ensures that shadows and clip boundaries on near-circular elements (where border-radius is close to 50%) precisely match the visual contour of the curved edge.

This produces a more consistent rendering of complex rounded shapes, eliminating visual discrepancies for high radius values. The border-radius adjustment factor, which ensures corners appear sharp for small radii, is now progressively dampened as the radius value approaches 50%.

This also applies to non-round contours (using corner-shape), which now use the same radius adjustment mechanism.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### ReportLayoutShiftRectsInCssPixels

This feature changes the attribution data (prevRect and currentRect) in the [LayoutShift API](https://wicg.github.io/layout-instability/) to be reported in CSS pixels instead of physical pixels.
The current behavior is inconsistent with other layout-related APIs, which all use CSS pixels. This change improves consistency, simplifies usage for developers, and aligns with expected units in debugging and tooling. The feature is gated behind a flag for experimentation and evaluation. The feature can be enabled for testing using the command-line flag:
`--enable-blink-features=ReportLayoutShiftRectsInCssPixels`

* []()


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Scroll Triggered Animations

This feature adds scroll-position-based control of animations, e.g. playing, pausing, and resetting an animation.

A common pattern on pages across the web is to kick off an animation when a scroll position is reached. Developers often do this by using JavaScript to manually detect that an element is within its scroll container's viewport and to kick off a corresponding animation (e.g. perhaps sliding that element into view). Many of such use cases are based on information that can be provided declaratively. This feature gives authors the ability to create such interactions declaratively via CSS, allowing the user agent to offload the handling of this interaction to a worker thread. The API also includes JavaScript interfaces that allow the feature to be extended to web animations in addition to CSS animations.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Secure Payment Confirmation: Browser Bound Keys

Adds an additional cryptographic signature over Secure Payment Confirmation assertions and credential creation. The corresponding private key is not synced across devices. This helps web developers meet requirements for device binding for payment transactions.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Show true window position on Android

Chrome on Android accurately reports the browser window's position and size using window.screenX, window.screenY, window.outerWidth, and window.outerHeight.

Previously Chrome incorrectly assumed all browser windows on Android start at coordinates (0, 0). This is inaccurate for Android tablets using freeform windowing mode, causing websites to always receive 0 when querying the window's on-screen position using window.screenX and window.screenY (these fields store the coordinates of window's top-left corner in global work area coordinate space).

Moreover, Chrome on Android incorrectly assumed that outer dimensions of the browser window are equal to the inner dimensions of the website viewport.

Remark: window.screenX and window.screenY have aliases, window.screenLeft and window.screenTop.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Trusted Types spec alignment

Trusted Types (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) was originally implemented and launched in Chromium in 2019, and has since found use in numerous websites. It has recently gained interest from other browser vendors.

The Trusted Type spec was co-written as a "monkey patch" spec along with our original implementation. It now receives fresh attention as others are trying to implement the same spec. It has now been "upstreamed" into HTML + DOM (plus a bit of CSP). As part of that process, various inconsistencies are being identified and fixed. Some of these fixes may be developer observable. This intent is to update our implementation to match the spec, as it's upstreamed into HTML.

Meanwhile, WebKit has launched their implementation of the updated Trusted Types spec, which gives us high confidence that this update is highly web compatible.

#### Upsert

ECMAScript proposal for Map.prototype.getOrInsert, Map.prototype.getOrInsertComputed, WeakMap.prototype.getOrInsert, and WeakMap.prototype.getOrInsertComputed.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### UserAgentReduction policy removal

Starting in Chrome 145, the **UserAgentReduction**  policy will be completely removed. This policy was previously available to control whether Chrome sent a reduced or full User-Agent string. 

To enhance user privacy and reduce passive tracking capabilities, Chrome began reducing the information contained in the User-Agent header by default in Chrome version 110. The **UserAgentReduction** policy was provided as a temporary measure for enterprises to manage this transition.

The recommended mechanism for websites to access browser and device information is now User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH). UA-CH requires websites to actively request specific information, which is a more privacy-preserving approach than the legacy User-Agent string. For more details, [see here:](https://web.dev/articles/migrate-to-ua-ch)

From Chrome 145 onwards, the **UserAgentReduction** policy will have no effect. Chrome will send a reduced User-Agent string by default. Systems or applications that relied on this policy to receive the full (legacy) User-Agent string may no longer receive the detailed information they expect.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU: `subgroup_uniformity` feature

Functionality added to the WebGPU spec after its first shipment in a browser.

Adds a new scope to the uniformity analysis and changes which parts of the language are checked in each to allow subgroup functionality to be considered uniform in more cases.

* []()


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `text-justify` CSS property

Support of `text-justify` CSS property

Web authors can control how text is justified when `text-align: justify` is applied by using the `text-justify` property.  For example, they can force justification by expanding inter-character space even in English text.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### meta name=&quot;text-scale&quot;

Makes the root element's default font size scale in proportion to both the operating system's and browser's text scale setting. This allows pages that follow best practices around font-relative units (i.e. use rem and em for font sizes and page elements that should change with the user's text size preferences) to respect the user's OS-level text scale setting. This also causes the browser to disable existing browser-based mechanisms (i.e. full-page zoom on windows) and heuristics (i.e. text autosizing on mobile). Now web developers can signal to the browser that the page is constructed in a way (i.e. with rem and em) that will scale well across various user-selected font size preferences. Similar to env(preferred-text-scale), which provides authors with a way to access the text scale; this API extends that by enabling scaling via the root element's default font size and opting-out of automatic text scaling.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### trigger-scope

trigger-scope gives authors the ability to limit the names of animation triggers declared by trigger-instantiating properties.

Trigger-Instantiating properties, such as timeline-trigger, declare names which can be referenced by the animation-trigger property in order to attach animations to triggers. However, these names are global by default (similar to anchor-name) and it is often useful for author to limit the visibility of the names so as to isolate animation-to-trigger interactions.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated or removed features

**TODO: CHECK THE FEATURES LISTED BELOW AND ADD THEM TO THE SITE-COMPAT-IMPACTING-CHANGES ARTICLE.**



<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Remove BMP Extension for Embedding JPEG-or-PNG-in-BMP

Chrome will remove BMP extension for embedding JPEG-or-PNG-in-BMP for the following reasons:

Security
========

We have compelling evidence that surprising and rarely-used support for nesting formats is a path to security bugs. Such a possibility is especially worrying for BMP, which is otherwise considered a pretty simple format.

Interoperability
================

* Today only Chrome supports this BMP extension.  (Tested with Chrome 141.0.7390.134, Firefox 143.0.4 and 144.0.2, Safari 18.6)
* There is no official spec. 
* Mozilla Developer Network advises against using BMP in general, and this BMP extension specifically (calling it only “theoretically supported”)
 
No usage
========

No usage has been registered via UMA data (see https://crbug.com/452667935).  Not just minimal usage, but no usage whatsoever.

Viable alternatives
===================

If our research data missed an existing usage of JPEG-or-PNG-embedded-in-BMP then we kindly ask web developers to use PNG and/or JPEG images **directly** rather than embedding them inside a BMP format.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Proofreader API

Expires on May 19, 2026.

The Proofreader API is a JavaScript API that proofreads input text with suggested corrections, backed by an AI language model. This API exposes high-level functionality to help web developers perform real-time proofreading and offers two specific features: error correction , and error labeling (identifying the error type like spelling or grammar). Developers can use this API to proofread user messages in chat applications , help polish email drafting , catch errors during note-taking , or provide high-quality interactive proofreading feedback when writing documents.

#### Prompt API

Expires on June 16, 2026.

Prompt API allows interacting with an AI language model using text, image, and audio inputs. It supports various use cases, from generating image captions and performing visual searches to transcribing audio, classifying sound events, generating text following specific instructions, and extracting information or insights from text. It supports structured outputs which ensure that responses adhere to a predefined format, typically expressed as a JSON schema, to enhance response conformance and facilitate seamless integration with downstream applications that require standardized output formats.

#### Incoming Call Notifications

Expires on May 19, 2026.

Extend the Notifications API to allow installed PWA&#39;s to send incoming call notifications - i.e., notifications with call-styled buttons and a ringtone. This extension will help VoIP web apps to create more engaging experiences by making it easier for users to easily recognize a calling notification and answer it. Besides that, this feature will help bridge the gap between native and web implementations of apps that have them both.

#### UserMediaElement

Expires on July 14, 2026.

The current web permission model for UserMedia relies on JavaScript-triggered prompts, giving the user agent no strong signal of user intent. This results in out-of-context prompts, user frustration, and difficult-to-recover-from denial states.

We propose the &lt;usermedia&gt; element, a semantic HTML control with browser-controlled content and strict styling constraints. These constraints are fundamental to the security model, ensuring a very high level of confidence in the user&#39;s intent when making a permission decision at both the site and OS level.

Crucially, the &lt;usermedia&gt; element evolves beyond simply managing permissions; it streamlines the entire journey by also directly providing UserMedia stream to the site. This often eliminates the need for separate JavaScript API calls, simplifying implementation and creating a more seamless user flow.

By providing a clear, consistent, in-page control, this element solves significant user problems related to context blindness and &quot;permission regret,&quot; offering a simple recovery path from a previously denied state. The combination of a user-initiated element and a subsequent browser-controlled confirmation UI enhances intent capture, improves accessibility, and prevents manipulative patterns, providing a significantly better experience for both users and developers.

#### Local Network Access from Non-Secure Contexts

Expires on May 19, 2026.

Temporarily allows for access to resources on local networks to originate from non-secure contexts. This will give developers more time to migrate Local Network Access requests to originate from a secure context. More information on Local Network Access restrictions can be found at https://developer.chrome.com/blog/local-network-access. This origin trial can only be enabled through HTTP header provided origin tokens.
