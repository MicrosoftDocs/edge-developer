<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## CSS features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Scroll-triggered animations

Scroll-triggered animations control the play state of animations based on a scroll position.

Scroll-triggered animations are useful for cases where you want to start an animation, such as sliding an element into view, only when a certain scroll position is reached.

This feature makes it possible to achieve this common effect without using JavaScript to manually detect that an element is within its scroll container's viewport. This also means that the browser can offload the handling of the interaction to a worker thread, which improves performance.

See also:
* [Explainer for the Scroll-Triggered animations](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/scroll-triggered-animations/blob/main/README.md)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### trigger-scope

The `trigger-scope` property lets you define the scope within which the names of animation triggers apply.

For example, scroll-triggered animations use the `timeline-trigger` and `animation-trigger` properties to define custom trigger names. By default, those names are global, meaning that they can be referenced from anywhere in the document.

By using the `trigger-scope` property, you can limit the visibility of those trigger names to a specific scope.

See also:
* [Trigger Name Scoping: the trigger-scope property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/#trigger-scope)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Percentage values for `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing`

The `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` CSS properties now support percentage values.

Percentage values are calculated relative to the advance measure of the space character `U+0020`.

The ability to use percentage values gives you more robust and flexible control over typography, particularly in responsive designs where text spacing needs to adapt to different viewports and font sizes.

See also:
* [letter-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/letter-spacing) at MDN.
* [word-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/word-spacing) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Support for column wrapping in multi-column layouts

Multi-column layouts, such as those created by using the `column-count` or `column-width` CSS properties, now support column wrapping.

You control column wrapping by using the `column-wrap` and `column-height` CSS properties.

With column wrapping, instead of letting the height of your columns be defined by the parent element, you can define an explicit height for your columns. A new row of columns is created when all columns have been filled for one row.

See also:
* [The overflow direction: the column-wrap property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-2/#cwr)
* [The Block Size of Columns: the column-height property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-2/#ch)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Customizable select listbox

Customizable selects can now also be rendered as single-select or multi-select in listbox mode.

The listbox rendering mode means that the select element is rendered in the page rather than with a separate button and popup.

To render a customizable select in listbox mode, use the `multiple` or `size` HTML attributes. For example: `<select multiple>` or `<select size="4">`.

See also:
* [Customizable select elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Improved rendering for near circular border radius.

The rendering of near-circular elements, such as those that have a `border-radius` that's close to 50%, has been improved. The shadows and clip boundaries of these elements now precisely match the visual contour of the elements' curved edges.

This improvement also applies to non-round contours, such as those using the `corner-shape` property.

See also:
* [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/border-radius) at MDN.
* [corner-shape](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/corner-shape) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `text-justify`

The `text-justify` property lets you control how text is justified when using `text-align: justify;`.

For example, you can force justification by expanding inter-character space even in English text by using `text-justify: inter-character`.

See also:
* [text-justify](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/text-justify) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Monochrome emoji rendering in forced colors mode

To improve accessibility, Microsoft Edge now renders monochrome emojis in forced colors mode, such as when the user is using a contrast theme on Windows.

See also:
* [forced-colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media/forced-colors) at MDN.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web APIs


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Origin API

The Origin API provides helpful methods for comparison, serialization, or parsing or an origin.

The origin is a fundamental component of the web that's essential to both the security and privacy boundaries which browsers maintain.

Browsers have always had internal representations of a web page's origin. The new Origin API exposes this internal representation to you.

Using the Origin API, you can do same-origin or same-site comparisons in a more robust way than by using the other existing origin getters which all return ASCII serializations of origins.

See also:
* [The Origin interface](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#the-origin-interface)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### PerformanceEntry presentationTime and paintTime properties

The `paintTime` and `presentationTime` properties are now available for the following Performance API entries:

* Element timing
* Largest Contentful Paint
* Long Animation Frames
* Paint timing

The `paintTime` property indicates the time at which the rendering phase ended and the browser started the paint phase.

The `presentationTime` property indicates the time at which the pixels reached the screen.

See also:
* [Performance APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance_API) at MDN.
* [PerformanceElementTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceElementTiming) at MDN.
* [LargestContentfulPaint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LargestContentfulPaint) at MDN.
* [PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming) at MDN.
* [PerformancePaintTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformancePaintTiming) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Require sticky user activation or permission for clipboardchange events

To prevent unauthorized system clipboard monitoring, the `clipboardchange` event is now only emitted when the page is in sticky user activation mode or when the `clipboard-read` permission has been granted by the user.

Sticky user activation happens when the user is actively interacting with the web page or has interacted with the page at least once.

See also:
* [The clipboardchange event](./144.md#the-clipboardchange-event) in Microsoft Edge 144 web platform release notes (Jan. 2026).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `onanimationcancel` event handler

Like `onanimationstart`, `onanimationiteration`, and `onanimationend`, the `onanimationcancel` event handler is now available.

This makes it possible to detect when an animation stops running even when this animation didn't reach its natural end, for example when the `animation-name` CSS property is changed, or when the animating element gets hidden by using `display:none`.

See also:
* [Element: animationcancel event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/animationcancel_event) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### IDNA ContextJ rules

To improve interoperability with other browsers, Microsoft Edge now implements the IDNA ContextJ rules, by disallowing ZWNJ (U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and ZWJ (U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER) characters in most places within URLs.

IDNA is the mechanism by which non-ASCII characters can occur in domain names.  For example, the URL `http://네이버.한국/` is encoded as `http://xn--950bt9s8xi.xn--3e0b707e/`.

See also:
* [Better Unicode support](./143.md#better-unicode-support) in _Microsoft Edge 143 web platform release notes (Dec. 2025)_.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Map and WeakMap `getOrInsert` and `getOrInsertComputed` methods

The Map and WeakMap `getOrInsert` methods return the value corresponding to the specified key in the map. If the key is not present, it inserts a new entry with the key and a given default value, and returns the inserted value.

The Map and WeakMap `getOrInsertComputed` methods return the value corresponding to the specified key in this map. If the key is not present, it inserts a new entry with the key and a default value computed from a given callback, and returns the inserted value.

See also:
* [Proposal Upsert](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-upsert)
* [Map.prototype.getOrInsert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/getOrInsert) at MDN.
* [Map.prototype.getOrInsertComputed()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/getOrInsertComputed) at MDN.
* [WeakMap.prototype.getOrInsert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap/getOrInsert) at MDN.
* [WeakMap.prototype.getOrInsertComputed()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap/getOrInsertComputed) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### LayoutShift API reports in CSS pixels

The `prevRect` and `currentRect` data that's returned by the LayoutShift API now reports lengths in CSS pixels instead of physical pixels.

This change makes the LayoutShift API consistent with other layout-related APIs, which all use CSS pixel units.

See also:
* [LayoutShift](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LayoutShift) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Text-scale meta element

The `text-scale` meta element, such as `<meta name="text-scale" content="scale">`, makes the default font-size of a web page's root element consistent with the operating system's and browser's text scale settings.

Previously, there was no easy way to respect the text scale which the user defined at the operating system level.

The `text-scale` meta element is useful if you follow best practices around font-relative units, such as by using `rem` and `em` font size units to respect the user's text size preferences.

This feature also allows the browser to disable its own browser-based mechanisms and heuristics, such as full-page zoom on windows or text autosizing on mobile. Now, you can signal to the browser that the page is constructed in a way that will scale well across various user-selected font size preferences.

See also:
* [Text-Scale meta element](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-5/#text-scale-meta)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Cookie Store API `maxAge` attribute

To define a cookie's expiry time, you can now use the `maxAge` attribute when using the Cookie Store API.

This is in addition to the `expires` attribute which already controls a cookie's expiry time. The `maxAge` attribute provides a more idiomatic option and aligns the Cookie Store API with the options provided by `document.cookie` and the `Set-Cookie` HTTP Header.  

See also:
* [Cookie Store API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `focusVisible` option for the `focus()` method

When calling the `focus()` method, you can now supply the `focusVisible` boolean option.

* When `focusVisible` is set to true, a focus ring is displayed around the newly-focused element and the `:focus-visible` CSS pseudo-class is matched.

* When `focusVisible` is false, no focus ring is displayed and the `:focus-visible` CSS pseudo-class doesn't match.

* When `focusVisible` is missing, the browser makes its own determination as to whether a focus ring should be displayed around the newly focused element, and the `:focus-visible` CSS pseudo-class matches accordingly.

See also:
* [HTMLElement: focus() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `VideoFrame.metadata()` now returns `rtpTimestamp` for WebRTC video frames

The new `VideoFrame.metadata()` method returns a dictionary that contains the `rtpTimestamp` field if the underlying `VideoFrame` browser object has this field in its metadata already. An empty dictionary is returned otherwise.

Only video frames that originate from a WebRTC source have the `rtpTimestamp` metadata.

The `rtpTimestamp` field allows applications that use a MediaStreamTrackProcessor, for example to render decoded WebRTC frames to a canvas, or WebCodecs, for example for custom decoding pipelines, to correlate each exposed frame with its original RTP transport timestamp.

See also:
* [VideoFrameMetadata](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-extensions/#videoframemetadata) in Media Capture and Streams Extensions.
* [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### New input event types for keyboard deletion commands on selected text

When keyboard deletion commands such as **Ctrl+Backspace** or **Ctrl+Delete** are used with selected text a in `contenteditable` element, the `beforeinput` and `input` events now report the following input event types:
* `deleteContentBackward`
* `deleteContentForward`

Previously, the following event types were reported:
* `deleteWordBackward`
* `deleteWordForward`

This change enables you to detect which editing operation occurred and implement reliable undo/redo mechanisms, or other custom editing behaviors.

See also:
* [InputEvent: inputType property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/InputEvent/inputType) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `to` property for Navigation API transitions

NavigationTransition objects now have a `to` property, which exposes the destination of the navigation, in addition to the existing `from` property, which exposes the source of the navigation.

The `from` and `to` properties are useful when using precommit handlers. Precommit handlers are used during same-document navigation via the `NavigateEvent.intercept()` method, to modify or cancel in-flight navigation, or to perform work while the navigation is ongoing and before it is committed.

See also:
* [Navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API) at MDN.
* [NavigationPrecommitController](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NavigationPrecommitController) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### The `dropEffect` value is now preserved from `dragover` to `drop` events

When using the Drag and Drop API, the last `dataTransfer.dropEffect` value set during a `dragover` event is now preserved and available during the subsequent `drop` event.

Previously, Edge was overwriting the `dropEffect` value with its own negotiated operation before the `drop` event fired, which wasin contradiction with the specification.

See also:
* [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) at MDN.
* [DataTransfer: dropEffect property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/dropEffect) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Browser Bound Keys in the Secure Payment Confirmation API

The Secure Payment Confirmation API can now keep up with syncing passkeys and device requirements for online payments.  The Browser Bound Keys feature adds device binding in the browser, to enable payment scenarios in which device binding is required.

This feature helps meet requirements for device binding for payment transactions.

See also:
* [Using Secure Payment Confirmation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API/Using_secure_payment_confirmation) at MDN.
* [Browser Bound Key Store](https://w3c.github.io/secure-payment-confirmation/#sctn-browser-bound-key-store) in _Secure Payment Confirmation_.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `confidence` field to detect representative navigation timing performance entries

The `confidence` field on the PerformanceNavigationTiming object makes it possible to detect if a navigation timing performance entry is representative of your web application's performance, or if it may have been affected by external factors, such as a cold start of the browser, or high system load.

When the browser first launches, it performs many expensive initialization tasks that compete for system resources. Browser extensions can also affect performance, since some extensions run additional code on every page users visit, increasing CPU usage and slowing response times. Likewise, when a machine is already busy with intensive tasks, web pages might load more slowly.

These factors make it more difficult to reliably detect if a performance issue exists within the code of your web application.

The `confidence` field provides a way to identify navigation timing performance entries that are more likely to be representative of your web application's performance.

See also:
* [Performance APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance_API) at MDN.
* [PerformanceNavigationTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming) at MDN.
* [PerformanceTimingConfidence interface](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#sec-performance-timing-confidence) in _Navigation Timing Level 2_.


<!-- todo: verify if this feature applies to Edge -->
<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Device-bound session credentials

Device-bound session credentials is a way for websoites to securely bind a user session to a single device, therefore reducing the risk of session theft.

Device-bound session credentials make the web safer for users in that it is less likely their identity is abused.

See also:
* [Device Bound Session Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-dbsc/)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
