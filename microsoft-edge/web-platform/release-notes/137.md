<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `if()` function

The CSS `if()` function provides a simple and concise way to express conditional logic values.

The `if()` function accepts a series of condition-value pairs, delimited by semicolons.  The function evaluates each condition sequentially, and returns the value associated with the first `true` condition.  If none of the conditions evaluate to `true`, the function returns an empty token stream.

In the following example, the `if()` function is used to set the background color of a `div` element based on the value of a custom property `--color`:

```html
<style>
  div {
    color: var(--color);
    background-color: if(style(--color: white): black; else: white);
  }
  .dark {
    --color: black;
  }
  .light {
    --color: white;
  }
</style>
<div class="dark">dark</div>
<div class="light">light</div>
```

See [Conditional Value Selection: the if() notation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/#if-notation) in _CSS Values and Units Module Level 5_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `reading-flow` and `reading-order` properties

The `reading-flow` CSS property controls the following:
* The order in which elements in a flex, grid, or block layout are exposed to accessibility tools.
* The order in which elements in a flex, grid, or block layout are focused when using the **Tab** key.

The `reading-flow` property supports the following values:

* `normal`
* `flex-visual`
* `flex-flow`
* `grid-rows`
* `grid-columns`
* `grid-order`
* `source-order`

The `reading-order` CSS property allows you to manually override the order within a reading flow container. The `reading-order` value is an integer which defaults to 0.

See also:

* [Reading Order: the reading-flow property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-4/#reading-flow) in _CSS Display Module Level 4_.
* [Overriding Reading Flow: the reading-order property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-4/#reading-order) in _CSS Display Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support for `shape()` in `offset-path`

The `shape()` CSS function, which is already supported by the  `clip-path` CSS property, is now support by the `offset-path` CSS property as well.

This allows the same shape to be reused across multiple CSS properties.

See [offset-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/offset-path) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### System accent color for `accent-color` property

The `accent-color` CSS property allows you to customize the color of form elements, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, or progress bars.

Now, the default color for the `accent-color` property matches the operating system accent color./g/blink-dev/c/WwYkLjbGhoA

See [accent-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Auto-generated view transition names

The `view-transition-name` CSS property supports two new values, to avoid having to invent unique names for elements that participate in a view transition:

* `match-element` - Generates a unique ID that's based on the element's identity.  This value is useful in single-page apps where the element that's animated with a view transition is being moved in the DOM.

* `auto` - Generates a unique ID that's based on the element's `id` attribute.  This value only takes the `id` attribute into account, and ignores the type of element.  This approach enables a view transition to work across multiple pages of an app, where elements with the same `id` attribute may be of different types.

See [Determining view-transition-name automatically](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#auto-vt-name).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support for the `transform` attribute on `<svg>`

Transform properties, such as scaling, rotation, translation, and skewing, are now supported on the `<svg>` element directly, by using the `transform` attribute.

This allows you to manipulate the entire SVG coordinate system or its contents as a whole, providing greater flexibility in creating dynamic, responsive, and interactive vector graphics.

By supporting the `transform` attribute, an `<svg>` element can be transformed without requiring additional wrapper elements or complex CSS workarounds.

See [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/transform) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Ignore `letter-spacing` in cursive scripts

Per specification, the browser now ignores the `letter-spacing` CSS property when rendering cursive scripts, to avoid breaking words.

If possible, the browser may apply letter spacing by translating the extra space into cursive elongation or compression.  If the text cannot be expanded without breaking cursive connections, the browser treats each word as a single typographic unit for letter spacing.

Proper cursive elongation or compression varies, based on:
* Script.
* Typeface.
* Language.
* Word location.
* Line location.
* Implementation complexity.
* Font capabilities.
* Calligraphic preferences.

Proper cursive elongation or compression may involve shortening:
* Ligatures.
* Swash variants.
* Contextual forms.
* Elongation glyphs.

Avoid applying the  `letter-spacing` property to cursive scripts, unless you can accept non-interoperable results.

See [letter-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Change the error type thrown for `payment` Web Authentication credential creation from `SecurityError` to `NotAllowedError`

Previously, when creating a `payment` credential in a cross-origin iframe without a user activation, a `SecurityError` was thrown.

The error type has now been changed to `NotAllowedError`, to match the type of errors that are thrown for non-payment credentials.

See [Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Allow the SVG `<use>` element to reference external documents without requiring a URL fragment ID

SVG `<use>` elements can now link to external SVG documents without needing to specify a fragment identifier.

Previously, you needed to explicitly reference fragments within SVG documents.  For example:

```html
<svg>
  <use xlink:href="myshape.svg#icon"></use>
</svg>
```

In the above example, `#icon` is the fragment identifier pointing to an element with the `id="icon"` attribute within the `myshape.svg` document.  If no identifier was given, the  `<use>` element was not be able to resolve the target and nothing was rendered.

You can now omit fragment identifiers and provide the external SVG document file name only.  Doing so automatically references the root element withing the SVG document.  For example:

```html
<svg>
  <use xlink:href="myshape.svg"></use>
</svg>
```

See [`<use>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/use) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Blob URL partitioning

Blob URL access is now partitioned by storage key.  Storage keys are top-level sites, frame origins, and the `has-cross-site-ancestor` boolean.  Top-level navigations remain partitioned only by frame origin.

Partitioning Blob URL access by storage key is similar to what's currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari.  This aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme that's used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning.

Along with that change, Microsoft Edge now enforces `noopener` on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs, where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site that's performing the navigation.  This aligns with similar behavior in Safari and with the corresponding specifications.

Blob URL partitioning can be temporarily reverted by setting the `PartitionedBlobUrlUsage` policy:
* If this policy is set to `Enabled` or is not set, Blob URLs are partitioned.
* If this policy is set to `Disabled`, Blob URLs are not partitioned.

See [Access restrictions on blob URLs](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#partitioningOfBlobUrls) in the File API specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Call stacks in crash reports from unresponsive web pages

When a webpage becomes unresponsive due to JavaScript code running a very long computation, such as an infinite loop, the Javascript call stack is recorded and included in the crash report that's sent to the Reporting API server endpoint that's configured by the website.

See [Reporting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Floating point color types in `<canvas>`

`CanvasRenderingContext2D`, `OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D`, and `ImageData` objects now support floating point pixel formats, in addition to 8-bit fixed point formats.

This change enables high-precision applications, such as:
* Medical visualizations.
* High dynamic range content.
* Linear working color spaces.

See [Canvas Floating Point Color Values](https://github.com/w3c/ColorWeb-CG/blob/main/canvas_float.md).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Document isolation policies

The document isolation policies allow a document to enable cross-origin isolation for itself, without having to use Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) or Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) response headers, and regardless of the cross-origin isolation status of the page.

See also:

* [Document-Isolation-Policy](https://wicg.github.io/document-isolation-policy/).
* [Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) at MDN.
* [Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Ed25519 signature algorithm support in Web Cryptography API

The Web Cryptography API now supports the Ed25519 signature algorithm.

See [Secure Curves in WebCrypto](https://github.com/WICG/webcrypto-secure-curves/blob/main/explainer.md).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) in WebAssembly

JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) is an API that allows WebAssembly applications to integrate with JavaScript Promises.

JSPI allows a WebAssembly program to act as the generator of a Promise, and it allows the WebAssembly program to interact with Promise-bearing APIs.

When an application uses JSPI to call a Promise-bearing (JavaScript) API:
* The WebAssembly code is suspended.
* The original caller to the WebAssembly program is given a Promise that will be fulfilled when the WebAssembly program finally completes.

See [js-promise-integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebAssembly branch hinting

To improve the performance of compiled WebAssembly code, branch hints are used to inform the engine that a particular branch instruction is very likely to take a specific path.

This allows the engine to make better decisions for code layout and register allocation.

See [Branch hinting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/branch-hinting/blob/main/proposals/branch-hinting/Overview.md).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Restrict the types of attributes and arguments that SVGMatrix, SVGRect, and SVGPoint accept

Setting attributes and arguments of SVGMatrix, SVGRect, and SVGPoint to `Infinity` or `NaN` is now disallowed.

Settings attributes or arguments to these values will now throw a JavaScript exception.

See [SVG API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SVG_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Selection API `getComposedRanges` and `direction`

The Selection API now supports the following property and method:

* `Selection.direction` returns the selection's direction as either `none`, `forward`, or `backward`.
* `Selection.getComposedRanges()` returns a list of 0 or 1 _composed_ `StaticRange` objects.

A composed `StaticRange` can cross shadow DOM boundaries, unlike `Range` objects.

For example:

```javascript
const range = getSelection().getComposedRanges({ shadowRoots: [root] });
```

To make sure unknown shadow trees are not exposed by accident, if the text selection crosses a shadow root boundary that isn't provided in the `shadowRoots` property, the returned `StaticRange`'s end points will be outside of that shadow tree.

See [Selection: getComposedRanges() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Selection/getComposedRanges) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU API


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Bind `externalTexture` to `GPUTextureView`

When creating a `GPUBindGroup` when using WepGPU, you can now bind `externalTexture` to a `GPUTextureView`.

This helps in scenarios such as when using the WebGPU API for video effects pipelines.  By allowing a compatible `GPUTextureView` to be used in place of a `GPUExternalTexture`, the shader logic is simplified.

See [GPUExternalTexture](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/GPUExternalTexture) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Copy entire buffers with `copyBufferToBuffer()`

The `GPUCommandEncoder.copyBufferToBuffer()` method makes it easier to copy entire buffers by allowing you to omit the `offsets` and `size` parameters.

See [GPUCommandEncoder: copyBufferToBuffer() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/GPUCommandEncoder/copyBufferToBuffer) at MDN.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

#### Microsoft Edge-only origin trials


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

Expires on August 31, 2025

`scope_extensions` is a new web application manifest member which enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.

Scope extensions allow web apps that rely on multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

```json
{
  "name": "Example app",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "origin": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The origins that are listed in the `scope_extensions` member must confirm that they are associated with the web app by hosting a configuration file named `.well-known/web-app-origin-association`.  The file must list the web app's origin:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```
