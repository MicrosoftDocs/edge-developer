<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edge DevTools

See [What's new in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 144)](../../devtools/whats-new/144.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## WebView2

See [Release SDK 1.0.3719.77, for Runtime 144](../../webview2/release-notes/index.md#release-sdk-10371977-for-runtime-144) (Jan. 27, 2026) in _Release notes for the WebView2 SDK_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## CSS features

Below are the new Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) features in Microsoft Edge.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### The `scrolled` feature for scroll-state container queries

The `scrolled` feature for a `@container scroll-state()` query makes it possible to style elements within a scrollable containers based on the container's most recent scrolling direction.

For example:

```css
.scrolling-up {
  translate: 80px 0;
  transition: 0.4s translate;
}

html {
  container-type: scroll-state;
}

@container scroll-state(scrolled: top) {
  .scrolling-up {
    translate: 0 0;
  }
}
```

The `scrolled` feature can be used to implement UI patterns such as a header that automatically hides as the user scrolls down the page and reappears as they scroll up.  The `scrolled` feature provides a CSS-only solution for these common UI patterns.

See also:
* [CSS scroll state container queries](./133.md#css-scroll-state-container-queries) in _Microsoft Edge 133 web platform release notes (Feb. 2025)_.
* [Scrolled: the scrolled feature](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-5/#scrolled) in _CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 5_.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS `transform` support in anchor positioning

When an anchor-positioned element is tethered to an element that's transformed, such as by using the CSS `transform` property, the anchor-positioned element is now correctly positioned relative to the bounding box of the transformed anchor.

This makes it possible to create UI effects where elements remain logically connected, even if one of the elements is being transformed.

See also:
* [CSS anchor positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Anchor_positioning) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Support for `overscroll-behavior` on keyboard scrolling and on non-scrollable containers

When you set the CSS `overscroll-behavior` property to a value other than `auto`, scroll chaining is prevented by the browser.  This means that when a user scrolls to the end of a scroll container, the scroll doesn't propagate to ancestor scroll containers.

In earlier versions of Microsoft Edge, this only worked for mouse or touch scrolling.  This change makes keyboard scrolling respect `overscroll-behavior` as well.

Additionally, `overscroll-behavior` now applies to all scroll container elements, regardless of whether those elements currently have overflowing content or are user-scrollable.  For example, you can now use `overscroll-behavior` to prevent scroll propagation on an `overflow: hidden` backdrop, or on an `overflow: auto` element, without needing to consider whether the element itself is overflowing.

See also:
* [overscroll-behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/overscroll-behavior) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Scroll-triggered animations

The `timeline-trigger` property can now trigger CSS animations based on a scroll position, and can control the playback of those animations as the user scrolls.

This feature is useful to implement common patterns where animations only start when a scroll position on the page has been reached.  Previously, developers often did this by using JavaScript to detect that an element is within its scroll container's viewport.  Using the CSS `timeline-trigger` property to trigger animations based on a scroll position instead can improve performance and reliability.

See also:
* [Timeline Triggers](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/#timeline-triggers) in _CSS Animations Module Level 2_.
* [Scroll-triggered animation demos](https://davmila.github.io/sta-demos/explore/).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Styling SVG elements instantiated via `<use>`

CSS rules that match SVG elements that are embedded into a document via the `<use>` SVG element now correctly match against the embedded elements.

Previously, the CSS rules matched the originating SVG elements instead of the elements instantiated via `<use>`.

See also:
* [`<use>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/use) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### View Transitions `waitUntil()` method

The `ViewTransition.waitUntil()` function enables more advanced uses of the View Transitions API.  The function accepts a Promise, which is used to delay the destruction of the pseudo-tree that's used to render and animate the view transition.

The View Transitions API automatically constructs this pseudo-element subtree to display and animate the elements that participate in a transition.

Normally:
* This subtree is constructed when the view transition starts animating.
* This subtree is destroyed when the animations that are associated with all view transition pseudo-elements are in the finished state.

That normal behavior works for the vast majority of cases.  In some cases, however, you might want the view transition pseudo-tree to persist beyond the animation finish state.  For example, if you tie a view transition with a scroll-driven animation, we don't want the subtree to be destroyed when the animations finish, because scrolling back should animate the pseudo-elements again.

See also:
* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.
* [CSS scroll-driven animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Scroll-driven_animations) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `caret-shape`

The `caret-shape` CSS property allows you to specify the shape of the text insertion caret.

See also:
* [caret-shape](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/caret-shape) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Style search results

The `::search-text` pseudo-element allows you to style the portions of text that match a user's search query when the user searches within a page by using **Ctrl+F** or **Command+F**.

The pseudo-element can be combined with the `:current` pseudo-class to style the currently highlighted search result differently from the other search results.

See also:
* [::search-text](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-search-text) in _CSS Pseudo-Elements Module Level 4_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web APIs

Below are the new Web API features in Microsoft Edge.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### The Temporal API

The Temporal API allows you to work with dates, times, time zones, and durations, and is more powerful than the Date API.

See also:
* [Temporal](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### The `clipboardchange` event

The `clipboardchange` event of the `navigator.clipboard` API fires when the user modifies the contents of the clipboard from a web app, or from any other system application.

The `clipboardchange` event allows you to react to clipboard changes, without having to read the clipboard contents at regular intervals of time (sometimes called _clipboard polling_).

See also:
* [Test the clipboardchange event—a more efficient way to monitor the clipboard](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/clipboardchange).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### The `variants` accessor property of `Intl.Locale`

The `variants` accessor property of a `Intl.Locale` instance returns the language tag variants that are associated with this locale, as a string of identifiers separated by dash (hyphen) characters (`-`).

For example, the 1901 German orthography variant is represented by the `de-1901` language tag, and can be accessed as follows:

```js
const locale = new Intl.Locale('de-1901');
console.log(locale.variants); // "1901"
```

See also:
* [Intl.Locale.prototype.variants](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/variants) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Mirroring of MathML operators in right-to-left mode

When rendering MathML operators in right-to-left mode, characters and glyphs can now be mirrored by changing them to another code point.

For characters, the mirroring is defined by the Unicode's `Bidi_Mirrored` property.  For example, a right (closing) parenthesis becomes a left (opening) parenthesis.

Some operators have no appropriate mirrored character.  In this situation, glyph-level mirroring applies instead.  By using the `rtlm` font feature, a glyph can be replaced by another glyph.

See also:
* [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/MathML) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Performance API `interactionCount` property

The new `performance.interactionCount` property returns the total number of interactions that have occurred on the page.

This feature is useful for computing the **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** metric value, which requires knowing the total number of interactions, in order to compute a high percentile score.

The `performance.interactionCount` property complements the Event Timing API, which is used to measure the performance of user interactions.  Some events that are returned by the Event Timing API have an `interactionId` value assigned to them, which is useful for grouping related interactions based on common physical user inputs or gestures.

See also:
* [Extensions to the Performance interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/#sec-extensions).
* [Performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### The `maintain-framerate-and-resolution` value for the `RTCDegradationPreference` enum

The `maintain-framerate-and-resolution` value for the `RTCDegradationPreference` enum allows an application to disable WebRTC's internal video adaptation mechanism, for cases where the application implements its own external video adaptation logic.

WebRTC has an internal video adaptation mechanism that optimizes video quality and performance by adjusting encoding settings.  This mechanism relies on hardcoded logic and thresholds, which might not yield optimal results across diverse use-cases.

The `maintain-framerate-and-resolution` value for the `RTCDegradationPreference` enum disables WebRTC's internal video adaptation.

See also:
* [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### LayoutShift API reports rect elements in CSS pixels

The LayoutShift API now reports information about the elements which have shifted, such as `previousRect` and `currentRect`, in CSS pixels rather than physical pixels.

This makes the API consistent with other layout-related web APIs, which all use CSS pixels.

See also:
* [LayoutShift](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LayoutShift) at MDN.
* [LayoutShiftAttribution](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/LayoutShiftAttribution) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Support for `ping`, `hreflang`, `type`, and `referrerPolicy` for SVG `<a>` elements

The `ping`, `hreflang`, `type`, and `referrerPolicy` attributes are now supported on SVG `<a>` elements.

This makes the SVG `<a>` element more consistent with the HTML `<a>` element.

See also:
* [Support `download` attribute in SVG `<a>` element](./142.md#support-download-attribute-in-svg-a-element) in _Microsoft Edge 142 web platform release notes (Oct. 2025)_.
* [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#download) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Exception on History API `pushState` and `replaceState` throttling

A `SecurityError` exception is now thrown when excessive use of the History API's `pushState` and `replaceState` methods is detected, such as when these methods are called hundreds of times per second.

Previously, the calls were ignored, and no errors were thrown.

See also:
* [History](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### User-Agent Client Hints `ch-ua-high-entropy-values` permissions policy

The `ch-ua-high-entropy-values` permissions policy allows a first-party site to have more control over which third-parties are allowed to request high-entropy User-Agent Client Hints via the `navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues()` API.

Previously, it was only possible to restrict third-party collection of high-entropy User-Agent Client Hints when they're requested over HTTP.

See also:
* [User-Agent Client Hints API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/User-Agent_Client_Hints_API) at MDN.
* [NavigatorUAData: getHighEntropyValues() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NavigatorUAData/getHighEntropyValues) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU: Uniform buffer standard layout

Uniform buffers that are declared in WGSL shaders are no longer required to have 16-byte alignment on array elements, or to pad nested structure offsets to a multiple of 16 bytes.

See also:
* [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU: `subgroup_id` feature

The `subgroup_id` and `num_subgroups` built-in values are now available when the subgroups extension is enabled.

See also:
* [WebGPU Subgroups](./134.md#webgpu-subgroups) in _Microsoft Edge 134 web platform release notes (Mar. 2025)_.
* [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebXR `XRVisibilityMaskChange` event

The `XRVisibilityMaskChange` event provides a list of vertices and a list of indices to represent the mesh of the visible portion of the user's viewport.

This data can be used to confidently limit how much of the viewport is drawn, to improve performance.

See also:
* [WebXR Device API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API) at MDN.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Deprecated or removed features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Externally loaded entities in XML parsing

Synchronous fetching of external XML entities/DTDs, which are then used when parsing under specific circumstances, has been removed.

This improves the security of XML parsing in Microsoft Edge.  Usage of this feature was very low, and other browsers don't support this feature.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Origin trials in Microsoft Edge

The following are origin trials for new experimental APIs that are available in Microsoft Edge.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Extended lifetime shared workers

Expires on April 21, 2026.

Extended-lifetime shared workers introduces the `extendedLifetime` option for the `SharedWorker` constructor.

This feature allows a shared worker to stay alive for a short period after all connected clients (such as pages) have been unloaded.  This is useful for performing asynchronous tasks that need to complete after a page unloads, such as saving data to IndexedDB, or sending analytics.

Without this feature, those tasks require a Service Worker, which can be too heavyweight for this use-case.  This origin trial provides a lightweight alternative.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Local Network Access from Non-Secure Contexts

Expires on May 19, 2026.

Local Network Access from non-secure contexts temporarily allows for access to resources on local networks to originate from non-secure contexts.  This gives you more time to migrate Local Network Access requests so that they originate from a secure context.

For restrictions on Local Network Access, see [New permission prompt for Local Network Access](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/local-network-access).  This origin trial can only be enabled through HTTP header-provided origin tokens.
