<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edge DevTools

See [What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 136)](../../devtools/whats-new/2025/05/devtools-136.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## WebView2

See [1.0.3240.44](../../webview2/release-notes/archive.md#10324044) (May 2025) in _Archived Release Notes for the WebView2 SDK_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `dynamic-range-limit` property

The `dynamic-range-limit` CSS property allows limiting the maximum brightness of High Dynamic Range (HDR) content.

See [Controlling Dynamic Range](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-hdr/#controlling-dynamic-range), in _CSS Color HDR Module Level 1_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Change the `string` CSS type in the `attr()` function to `raw-string`

In the `attr()` CSS function, instead of using a `string` type, use the `raw-string` type instead.

For example, `attr(data-foo string)` is now `attr(data-foo raw-string)`.

See [attr()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/attr) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Type-agnostic `var()` fallback

The `var()` CSS function accepts a fallback value as its second argument, in case the referenced custom property doesn't exist, or is invalid:

`width: var(--undefined-width, 100px)`

Previously, when the referenced custom property was registered with a specific type, by using the `@property` rule, the fallback value of a `var()` function only applied if it was of the same type as the referenced custom property.

This change allows the fallback value to be of any type, regardless of the type of the referenced custom property.

See [var()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/var) and [@property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@property) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Unprefixed `print-color-adjust`

The `print-color-adjust` CSS property now works without the `-webkit-` prefix.

The `print-color-adjust` property allows adjusting colors in a printed web page.

See [print-color-adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/print-color-adjust) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Fluent scrollbars

Overlay and non-overlay scrollbars now match the Fluent design language on Windows and Linux.

See [Fluent Scrollbars Visual Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haDpb1QIh2PaLwsQD1i4WHFq_5_jSK3XK9lhgSs4WkM/edit).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### AudioContext `interrupted` state

The `AudioContextState` interface now has an `interrupted` state.  The `interrupted` state allows the browser to pause playback in scenarios such as when using exclusive audio access (VoIP) or when a laptop lid is closed, and enables the web app to respond appropriately.

See [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Blob URL partitioning

Blob URL access is now partitioned by storage key.  Storage keys are top-level sites, frame origins, and the `has-cross-site-ancestor` boolean.  Top-level navigations remain partitioned only by frame origin.

Partitioning Blob URL access by storage key is similar to what's currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari.  This aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme that's used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning.

Along with that change, Microsoft Edge now enforces `noopener` on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs, where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site that's performing the navigation.  This aligns with similar behavior in Safari and with the corresponding specifications.

Blob URL partitioning can be temporarily reverted by setting the `PartitionedBlobUrlUsage` policy. If this policy is set to `Enabled` or is not set, Blob URLs are partitioned. If this policy is set to `Disabled`, Blob URLs are not partitioned.

See [Access restrictions on blob URLs](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#partitioningOfBlobUrls) in the File API specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Partitioning `:visited` links history

To eliminate leaking the user's browsing history, an HTML `<a>` element is now styled as `:visited` only if the link has previously been clicked from the top-level site and frame origin.  Microsoft Edge now partitions visited links according to three keys:
* The link URL.
* The top-level site.
* The frame origin.

By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, side-channel attacks that obtain `:visited` links styling information are prevented.

_Self-links_ are excluded from this protection; a link to a site's own pages can be styled as `:visited` even if the link hasn't been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before.  This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes which are same-origin with the top-level frame.

See [Explainer: Partitioning :visited links history](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/Partitioning-visited-links-history).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Navigation initiator used in the HTTP cache partition key

The browser's HTTP cache keying scheme now includes the boolean `is-cross-site-main-frame-navigation`.  Use this boolean to mitigate cross-site leak attacks that involve top-level navigation.

This boolean prevents a cross-site attack in which the attacker initiates a top-level navigation to a given page and then navigates to a resource that's known to be loaded by the page, in order to infer sensitive information via load timing.

This change also improves privacy by preventing a malicious site from using navigations to infer whether a user has previously visited a given site.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Captured surface control

The `CaptureController` API allows a video-conferencing app to control the zoom level and scroll position of the content of a browser tab that's used with screen sharing.

See the [Captured Surface Control](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-surface-control/) specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Captured surface resolution

The `screenPixelRatio` property of the `MediaStreamTrack` API exposes the pixel ratio of the captured surface while screen sharing.

This property allows an app to preserve system resources or adapt to the quality vs. bandwidth tradeoff, based on the physical resolution and logical resolution of the captured surface.

See [screenPixelRatio](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-screen-share/#dfn-screenpixelratio) in the Screen Capture specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Dispatching click events to captured pointer

If a pointer is captured while the `pointerup` event is being dispatched, the `click` event is dispatched to the captured target instead of being dispatched to the nearest common ancestor of `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events.

The `click` target remains unchanged for uncaptured pointers.

See [Event dispatch](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#event-dispatch) in the Pointer Events specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Explicit compile hints with magic comments

_Magic comments_ are comments that send a signal to the browser that the functions in a JavaScript file are likely to be needed by the website.  This allows the browser to parse, compile, or cache the functions eagerly, which can improve page load times.

In JavaScript, magic comments are comments that start with `//#`.

See [Explainer for Explicit JavaScript Compile Hints](https://github.com/WICG/explicit-javascript-compile-hints-file-based/blob/main/README.md).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### H265 (HEVC) codec support in WebRTC

The H265 (HEVC) codec has increased compression efficiency (higher quality per bitrate) relative to VP8/VP9/H264, and has very strong hardware support.

Support for the H265 (HEVC) codec in WebRTC improves the visual experience, increases battery life, and reduces the risk of performance issues.

See [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### H26x codec support updates for MediaRecorder

The MediaRecorder API now supports HEVC encoding.  This introduces the hvc1.* codec string, and adds new codecs (hev1.* and avc3.*), which support variable resolution video in MP4.

The MediaRecorder API now supports both MP4 and Matroska (*.mkv) formats with different HEVC and H.264 mime type specifications.  HEVC encoding is only supported if the user's device and operating system provide the necessary capabilities.

See [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Language support for `CanvasTextDrawingStyles`

The `lang` attribute can now be set on a `<canvas>` or `OffscreenCanvas` context.  This allows you to specify the language for text drawing and metrics in canvas.  Specifying the language is important for correct rendering of text in different languages, especially when rendering or measuring text content offscreen before outputting it to a visible canvas.

See [OffscreenCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Permissions Policy reports for iframes

Permissions Policy violation reports for cross-origin iframes are only sent to the iframe's reporting endpoint and not to the embedder's reporting endpoint, because of the concern that it might leak sensitive information about a cross-origin iframe.  However, this makes it difficult for a site to enforce Permissions Policy, because the site can't learn about breakages in cross-origin iframes.

The new violation called _Potential Permissions Policy violation_ analyzes:

* The existing Permissions Policy (including `report-only` policy).
* The `allow` attribute set in iframes.

Based on the above, the violation detects the conflict between the enforced Permissions Policy and the permissions being propagated to iframes.

See [Feature: Permissions Policy reports for iframes](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5154241037205504) at Chrome Platform Status.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Predictable reported storage quota

The StorageManager's `estimate`  now reports a predictable storage quota for sites that have limited storage permissions.

This prevents the detection of a user's browsing mode via the storage API by reporting an artificial quota.  The quota is the current usage + 10 gibibytes, in all browsing modes.

Sites with unlimited storage permissions and enforced quotas are unaffected.

See [Storage quotas and eviction criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_API/Storage_quotas_and_eviction_criteria) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Use the `double` type for ProgressEvent's `loaded` and `total` attributes

The `loaded` and `total` attributes of a `ProgressEvent` indicate the current progress.  The type of these attributes is now a floating point number between `0` and `1`, which aligns `ProgressEvent` with the default behavior of the `<progress>` HTML element, when the `max` attribute is omitted.

See [ProgressEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ProgressEvent) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `getCharNumAtPosition`, `isPointInFill`, and `isPointInStroke` now use `DOMPoint` objects

To match the SVGGeometryElement and SVGPathElement specifications, the `getCharNumAtPosition`, `isPointInFill`, and `isPointInStroke` methods now use `DOMPoint` objects instead of an `SVGPoint` objects.

See [DOMPoint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DOMPoint) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web Authentication Conditional Create

A _WebAuthn Conditional Create_ request lets a website create a passkey without prominent modal mediation, if the user previously consented to credential creation.

See [conditional](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/#dom-credentialmediationrequirement-conditional) in the Credential Management specificiation.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Return multiple identity providers in a single FedCM `get()` call

The Federated Credential Management API (FedCM) can now show multiple identity providers in the same dialog.

The `get()` method now returns all providers in a single call.  This allows a website to present all supported identity providers to users.

See [Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `RegExp.escape()`

The `RegExp.escape()` static method takes a string and returns an escaped version of that string, which can be used as a pattern inside a regular expression.

See [RegExp.escape()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/escape) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated or removed features

The following Web API features have been deprecated (still supported, but not recommended) or removed.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecate the `AutomaticHttpsDefault` policy

The `AutomaticHttpsDefault` policy is supported but discouraged in Microsoft Edge 136, and is planned to be removed in Microsoft Edge 139.  Instead, use the new `HttpsUpgradesEnabled`<!-- todo: add link to the new policy on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-update-policies when available --> policy, which is available starting in Microsoft Edge version 136.

###### `confidence` field on `PerformanceNavigationTiming` object

Expires on October 14, 2025.

The `PerformanceNavigationTiming` object now includes a `confidence` field.  Use the `confidence` field to evaluate whether navigation timings accurately reflect your web app's performance.  The data initially contains some noise, because this field employs differential privacy, to safeguard user privacy.  By gathering this field in your Real User Monitoring (RUM) data, you can filter out the noise with enough records to analyze trends and gain meaningful insights over time.
