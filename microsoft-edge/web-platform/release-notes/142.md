## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` system colors

The `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` system colors can now be used as CSS color values to access the system accent color specified on the user's device.

See also:
* [<system-color>](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/system-color) at MDN.
* [system Colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#css-system-colors) in _CSS Color Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `font-language-override` property

The `font-language-override` CSS property allows you to override the system language used for OpenType glyph substitution by specifying a four-character language tag directly in CSS.

This enables finer-grained typographic control for multilingual content or fonts with language-specific glyph variants.

See also:
* [font-language-override](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-language-override) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `document.activeViewTransition` property

The `document.activeViewTransition` property provides access to the currently running view transition, whether this transition is on a single web page, or between two web pages.

The View Transition API allows you to create visual transitions between different states of a single page, or between multiple pages.

For transitions within single pages, the `document.startViewTransition()` method returns a transition object.  The `document.activeViewTransition` property now provides access to this transition object, which means you no longer need to store the `document.startViewTransition()` return value.

For transitions between multiple pages, the `document.activeViewTransition` property now gives you access to the currently running transition object, for the duration of the transition. This is in addition to the `pageswap` and `pagereveal` events.

See also:
* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.
* [Document: startViewTransition() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) at MDN.
* [Window: pageswap event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pageswap_event) at MDN.
* [Window: pagereveal event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pagereveal_event) at MDN.


###### Range syntax for style container queries and `if()` functions

The CSS `@container style()` queries and `if()` functions now support the range syntax.

The range syntax makes it possible to compare custom properties and values by using the `<` and `>` operators.

For a comparison to be valid, both sides of the comparison must resolve to the same data type.  The range syntax is limited to the following numeric types: `<length>`, `<number>`, `<percentage>`, `<angle>`, `<time>`, `<frequency>`, and `<resolution>`.

Example comparing a custom property with a literal length:

```css
@container style(--inner-padding > 1em) {
  .card { border: 2px solid; }
}
```

Example comparing two literal values:

```css
@container style(1em < 20px) {
  ...
}
```

Example comparing a value from the `attr()` substitution function with a literal value:

```css
.item-grid {
  background-color: if(style(attr(data-columns, type<number>) > 2): lightblue; else: white);
}
```

See also:
* [Using container size and style queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_size_and_style_queries) at MDN.
* [if()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/if) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### SVG features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support `download` attribute in SVG `<a>` element 

The `download` attribute is now supported by SVG `<a>` elements.

The `download` attribute enables you to specify that the target of an SVG hyperlink should be downloaded rather than navigated to.

See also:
* [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/a) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS width and height support for SVG `<use>` element

The SVG `<use>` element now supports the `width` and `height` CSS properties.

This allows you to control the sizing of SVG elements through CSS, such as to improve their responsiveness.

With this feature, the following two HTML snippets now produce the same output:

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80" height="80">
      <rect width="100" height="100" fill="green" />
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" style="width:40px; height:40px" />
</svg>
```

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80" height="80">
      <rect width="100" height="100" fill="green" />
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" width="40" height="40" />
</svg>
```

* [`<svg>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/svg) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Clear the `window.name` value for cross-site navigations that switch browsing context group

Previously, the value of the `window.name` property was preserved throughout the lifetime of a browser tab, even when a cross-site navigation that switched browsing context groups happened.

The `window.name` property is now cleared when such a navigation occurs.

See also:
* [Window: name property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/name) at MDN.
* [Browsing context](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `clipboardchange` event

The Clipboard API now fires a `clipboardchange` event whenever the content of the system clipboard changes.

The `clipboardchange` event provides an efficient alternative to polling techniques, such as using JavaScript to read the clipboard content at regular intervals of time.

See also:
* [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `dataTransfer` property for `insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop`, and `insertReplacementText` input events

The input event objects of type `insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop`, and `insertReplacementText` now have a `dataTransfer` property, for better interoperability with other browsers.

The `dataTransfer` property provides access to the clipboard or drag-drop data when the user edits text within a `contenteditable` element.  The same data is also available on the `dataTransfer` property of `beforeinput` events.

This feature only applies to `contenteditable` elements.

See also:
* [DataTransfer](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) at MDN.
* [InputEvent: inputType property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/InputEvent/inputType) at MDN.
* [HTML contenteditable global attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable) at MDN.
* [Element: beforeinput event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/beforeinput_event) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Show third-party iframe origins in the FedCM UI

Previously, when using iframes with FedCM, the FedCM UI always displayed the origin from the top-level site, even if it differed from the iframe's origin.

This works well when the iframe is conceptually part of the top-level site even if its origin is different. For example, a top-level site at `example.com` might use a FedCM iframe at `example-static.com`, which it owns, but which is not meaningful to show to the user.

In other cases, FedCM iframes might belong to third-party sites. Showing the third-party iframe's origin to the user is important to help users make an informed decision about sharing their credentials with the third-party origin.

The `client_is_third_party_to_top_frame_origin` Relying Party (RP) metadata property allows you to show the third-party origin in the FedCM iframe.

See also:
* [Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### HSTS tracking prevention

Mitigates user tracking by third-parties via the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) cache.

This feature only allows HSTS upgrades for top-level navigations, and blocks HSTS upgrades for sub-resource requests.  Blocking such an HSTS upgrade makes it infeasible for third-party sites to use the HSTS cache in order to track a user across the web.

See also:
* [Strict-Transport-Security header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Only fire `pointerrawupdate` events in secure contexts

Previously, the `pointerrawupdate` event fired in both secure and insecure contexts, which didn't match the Pointer Events specification and other browsers.

Microsoft Edge now matches the specification and other browsers by only firing `pointerrawupdate` in secure contexts.

See also:
* [Element: pointerrawupdate event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerrawupdate_event) at MDN.
* [The pointerrawupdate event](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#the-pointerrawupdate-event) in _Pointer Events Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Enable sticky user activation across same-origin navigations

The sticky user activation state is now preserved after a the user navigates to a page that's on the same origin.

This allows you to directly make use of web features that normally require user activation, such as those listed at [Features gated by user activation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/User_activation), even after the user has navigated to another page of your site.

See also:
* [Sticky activation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Sticky_activation) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### New PWA manifest update algorithm

The updating of installed PWAs uses a new algorithm.  The new update algorithm makes the update process more deterministic and predictable, and gives you more control over whether, and when, updates should apply to existing installations of your app.

The new update algorithm has the following benefits:

* **Consistency:** The algorithm provides a consistent way to detect when a manifest update should happen.
* **Reduced user interruptions:** App users won't see the update dialog, except when it's strictly necessary, such as to confirm security-sensitive changes.
* **Browser flexibility:** Microsoft Edge can now allow known, trusted apps to update without displaying a notification, and can block updates for known bad apps.
* **Developer control:** You have more control over when the update dialog is shown to users.
* **Reduce network traffic:** Unnecessary network traffic is minimized.

* [Predictable Web App Updating - Explainer](https://github.com/WICG/manifest-incubations/blob/gh-pages/predictable-app-updating.md)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web Speech API contextual biasing

You can now provide a list of phrases to the Web Speech API for contextual biasing in speech recognition.

Currently the Web Speech API uses generalized speech recognition models and cannot prioritize certain words or phrases, or adapt to user-specific or domain-specific vocabularies. Listing recognition phrases provides the Web Speech API with an explicit mechanism to support contextual biasing.

See also:
* [phrases attribute](https://webaudio.github.io/web-speech-api/#dom-speechrecognition-phrases) in _Web Speech API_.
* [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) at MDN.
