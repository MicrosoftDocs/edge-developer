-->


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Enabled features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### AccentColor and AccentColorText system colors

The AccentColor and AccentColorText system colors can be used in CSS to access the system accent color specified on the user's device.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Clear window name for cross-site navigations that switches browsing context group

The value of the window.name property is currently preserved throughout the lifetime of a tab, even with navigation that switches browsing context groups, which can leak information and potentially be used as a tracking vector. Clear the window.name property in this case addresses this issue. This should be a low risk change since looking up a browsing context by name already does not work if it's in another browsing context group, so the name isn't actually useful.

Enterprise Policy: ClearWindowNameCrossSiteBrowsing (will stop working in Chrome 146)

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Clipboardchange event

The "clipboardchange" event fires whenever the system clipboard contents are changed either by a web app or any other system application. This allows web-apps like remote desktop clients to keep their clipboards synchronized with the system clipboard. It provides an efficient alternative to polling the clipboard(using Javascript) for changes.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### DataTransfer property for insertFromPaste, insertFromDrop and insertReplacementText input events

Populate the dataTransfer property on input events with inputType of insertFromPaste, insertFromDrop, and insertReplacementText to provide access to clipboard and drag-drop data during editing operations in contenteditable elements.

The dataTransfer object contains the same data that was available during the beforeinput event.

This feature only applies to contenteditable elements. For form controls (textarea, input), the behavior remains unchanged - the data property contains the inserted text and dataTransfer remains null.
Both Safari and Firefox already support this functionality. Chromium adopting this feature will enhance interoperability across browsers, providing a more consistent experience for web authors.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### FedCM—Support showing third-party iframe origins in the UI

Currently, FedCM always shows the toplevel site in its UI.

This works well when the iframe is conceptually first-party (e.g. foo.com may have an iframe foostatic.com, which is not meaningful to the user).

But if the iframe is actually third-party, it would be better to make it possible to show the iframe origin in the UI so that the user better understands who they are sharing their credentials with. For example, a photo editor may be embedded in a book publishing web app and may want to let users access files they have previously stored with the photo editor.

This proposal allows doing so.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### HSTS tracking prevention

Mitigates user tracking by third-parties via the HSTS cache.

This feature only allows HSTS upgrades for top-level navigations and blocks HSTS upgrades for sub-resource requests. Doing so makes it infeasible for third-party sites to use the HSTS cache in order to track users across the web.

See also:
* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Implement CSS property font-language-override

This feature introduces support for the font-language-override CSS property in Chromium. The property allows developers to override the system language used for OpenType glyph substitution by specifying a four-character language tag directly in CSS.

This enables fine-grained typographic control, particularly useful for multilingual content or fonts with language-specific glyph variants. The implementation will follow the behavior defined in CSS Fonts Level 3 and align with existing support in Firefox.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Interoperable pointerrawupdate events exposed only in secure contexts

The PointerEvents spec restricted pointerrawupdate to secure contexts in 2020, hiding both the event firing and the global event listeners from insecure contexts.  Through this feature, Chrome will match the updated spec and become interoperable with other major browsers.

See also:
* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Origin-Bound Cookies (by default)

In Chrome 142, cookies are bound to their setting origin (by default) such that they're only accessible by that origin i.e. sent on a request or visible through `document.cookie`.

Cookies may ease the host and port binding restrictions through use of the `Domain` attribute but all cookies will be bound to their setting scheme.

Temporary enterprise policies LegacyCookieScopeEnabled and LegacyCookieScopeEnabledForDomainList are available to revert this change. These policies will stop working in Chrome 150.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Range syntax for style container queries and if()

This feature enhances CSS style queries and the if() function by adding support for range syntax.

This extends style queries beyond exact value matching (e.g., style(--theme: dark)). Developers can now use comparison operators (>, <, etc.) to compare custom properties, literal values (like 10px or 25%), and values from substitution functions like attr() and env(). For a comparison to be valid, both sides must resolve to the same data type. This is limited to the following numeric types: <length>, <number>, <percentage>, <angle>, <time>, <frequency>, and <resolution>.

This allows for creating more dynamic components that adapt based on a range of inputs, not just predefined states.

Examples:

/* Compare a custom property against a literal length */
@container style(--inner-padding > 1em) {
  .card { border: 2px solid; }
}

/* Compare two literal values */
@container style(1em < 20px) {
  ...
}

/* Using style ranges in if() */
.item-grid {
  background-color: if(style(attr(data-columns, type<number>) > 2): lightblue; else: white);
}

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Sticky user activation across same-origin navigations

This feature preserves the sticky user activation state after a page navigates to another same-origin page.  The lack of user activation in the post-navigation page prevents some use cases like showing virtual keyboards on auto-focus, and this has been a blocker for the developers who want to build MPAs over SPAs.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support `download` attribute in SVG &lt;a&gt; element 

This feature introduces support for the download attribute on the SVGAElement interface in Chromium, aligning with the SVG 2 specification. The download attribute enables authors to specify that the target of an SVG hyperlink should be downloaded rather than navigated to, mirroring the behavior already supported in HTMLAnchorElement. This enhancement promotes interoperability across major browsers and ensures consistent behavior between HTML and SVG link elements, thereby improving developer experience and user expectations.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support width and height as presentation attributes for &lt;use&gt; element

This feature enables support for applying width and height to the <use> element using both presentation attributes and CSS properties.

Previously, Chromium only supported setting width and height on <use> via CSS. Presentation attributes were ignored or inconsistently applied, leading to rendering differences and developer confusion.

With this update:
Presentation attributes (width, height) are now supported on <use>.
Viewport resolution now prioritizes the <use> element’s dimensions over those defined in the referenced <symbol> or nested <svg>.

This ensures consistent rendering regardless of whether developers use CSS or markup-based styling.

Using CSS:
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80px" height="80px">
      <rect width="100px" height="100px" fill="green"/>
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" style="width:40px; height:40px"/>
</svg>

Using Presentation Attributes:
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80px" height="80px">
      <rect width="100px" height="100px" fill="green"/>
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" width="40px" height="40px"/>
</svg>

Both now produce the same visual result, which was not guaranteed before this change.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web App Manifest: specify update eligibility, icon urls are Cache-Control: immutable

Specify an update eligibility algorithm in the manifest spec. This makes the update process more deterministic and predictable, giving the dev more control over whether (and when) updates should apply to existing installations, and allowing removal of the 'update check throttle' that user agents currently need to implement to avoid wasting network resources.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web Speech API contextual biasing

This feature enables websites to support contextual biasing for speech recognition by adding a recognition phrase list to the Web Speech API.

Developers can provide a list of phrases as well as updating them to apply a bias to the speech recognition models in favor of those phrases. This helps improve accuracy and relevance for domain-specific and personalized speech recognition.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### activeViewTransition property on document

View Transitions API allows developers to start visual transitions between different states. The primary SPA entry point to this is `startViewTransition()` which returns a transition object. This object contains several promises and functionality to track the transition progress, as well as allow manipulations such as skipping the transition or modifying its types.

The proposal here is ergonomic in nature: instead of requiring that users store this object in some sort of way for easy access, provide a `document.activeViewTransition` property that represents this object, or null if there is no transition ongoing.

Note this similarly applies to MPA transitions, where the object is only available via `pageswap` and `pagereveal` events. In this proposal `document.activeViewTransition` would be set to this object for the duration of the transition.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features

**TODO: CHECK THE FEATURES LISTED BELOW AND ADD THEM TO THE SITE-COMPAT-IMPACTING-CHANGES ARTICLE.**



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecating savedTabGroups as individual value in SyncTypesListDisabled

Current policy behavior:
    ◦ Presently, the SyncTypesListDisabled enterprise policy allows administrators to specifically disable the synchronization of "savedTabGroups" on desktop platforms.
    ◦ It's worth noting that on mobile platforms, the synchronization of Tab Groups functionality is already managed by the "tabs" datatype.

To align desktop behavior with mobile and simplify sync management, the individual "savedTabGroups" datatype will be deprecated and will no longer be an individually customizable value within the SyncTypesListDisabled policy

Action required by administrators: Starting with Chrome 142, if your SyncTypesListDisabled policy disables either "tabs" or "savedTabGroups", both data types will now be considered disabled. This means that disabling "tabs" will also disable saved tab groups, and vice-versa. The "savedTabGroups" value will be entirely removed from the list of supported datatypes for this policy. For admins who have saved tab groups disabled, and intend to keep this behavior, make sure to explicitly disable the "tabs" datatype. This will guarantee the desired behavior before the "savedTabGroups" value is fully removed.
