<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` system colors

The `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` system colors can now be used as CSS color values to access the system accent color specified on the user's device.

See also:
* [<system-color>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color) at MDN.
* [system Colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#css-system-colors) in _CSS Color Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `font-language-override` property

The `font-language-override` CSS property allows you to override the system language used for OpenType glyph substitution by specifying a four-character language tag directly in CSS.

This enables finer-grained typographic control for multilingual content or fonts with language-specific glyph variants.

See also:
* [font-language-override](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-language-override) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `document.activeViewTransition` property

The `document.activeViewTransition` property provides access to the currently running view transition, whether this transition is on a single web page, or between two web pages.

The View Transition API allows you to create visual transitions between different states of a single page, or between multiple pages.

For transitions within single pages, the `document.startViewTransition()` method returns a transition object.  The `document.activeViewTransition` property now provides access to this transition object, which means you no longer need to store the `document.startViewTransition()` return value.

For transitions between multiple pages, the `document.activeViewTransition` property now gives you access to the currently running transition object, for the duration of the transition. This is in addition to the `pageswap` and `pagereveal` events.

* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.
* [Document: startViewTransition() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) at MDN.
* [Window: pageswap event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pageswap_event) at MDN.
* [Window: pagereveal event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pagereveal_event) at MDN.


###### Range syntax for style container queries and `if()` functions

The CSS `@container style()` queries and `if()` functions now support the range syntax.

The range syntax makes it possible to compare custom properties and values by using the `<` and `>` operators.

For a comparison to be valid, both sides of the comparison must resolve to the same data type.  The range syntax is limited to the following numeric types: `<length>`, `<number>`, `<percentage>`, `<angle>`, `<time>`, `<frequency>`, and `<resolution>`.

Example comparing a custom property with a literal length:

```css
@container style(--inner-padding > 1em) {
  .card { border: 2px solid; }
}
```

Example comparing two literal values:

```css
@container style(1em < 20px) {
  ...
}
```

Example comparing a value from the `attr()` substitution function with a literal value:

```css
.item-grid {
  background-color: if(style(attr(data-columns, type<number>) > 2): lightblue; else: white);
}
```

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Clear window name for cross-site navigations that switches browsing context group

The value of the window.name property is currently preserved throughout the lifetime of a tab, even with navigation that switches browsing context groups, which can leak information and potentially be used as a tracking vector. Clear the window.name property in this case addresses this issue. This should be a low risk change since looking up a browsing context by name already does not work if it's in another browsing context group, so the name isn't actually useful.

Enterprise Policy: ClearWindowNameCrossSiteBrowsing (will stop working in Chrome 146)

<!-- ---------- -->
###### `clipboardchange` event

The "clipboardchange" event fires whenever the system clipboard contents are changed either by a web app or any other system application. This allows web-apps like remote desktop clients to keep their clipboards synchronized with the system clipboard. It provides an efficient alternative to polling the clipboard(using Javascript) for changes.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### DataTransfer property for insertFromPaste, insertFromDrop and insertReplacementText input events

Populate the dataTransfer property on input events with inputType of insertFromPaste, insertFromDrop, and insertReplacementText to provide access to clipboard and drag-drop data during editing operations in contenteditable elements.

The dataTransfer object contains the same data that was available during the beforeinput event.

This feature only applies to contenteditable elements. For form controls (textarea, input), the behavior remains unchanged - the data property contains the inserted text and dataTransfer remains null.
Both Safari and Firefox already support this functionality. Chromium adopting this feature will enhance interoperability across browsers, providing a more consistent experience for web authors.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### FedCM—Support showing third-party iframe origins in the UI

Currently, FedCM always shows the toplevel site in its UI.

This works well when the iframe is conceptually first-party (e.g. foo.com may have an iframe foostatic.com, which is not meaningful to the user).

But if the iframe is actually third-party, it would be better to make it possible to show the iframe origin in the UI so that the user better understands who they are sharing their credentials with. For example, a photo editor may be embedded in a book publishing web app and may want to let users access files they have previously stored with the photo editor.

This proposal allows doing so.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### HSTS tracking prevention

Mitigates user tracking by third-parties via the HSTS cache.

This feature only allows HSTS upgrades for top-level navigations and blocks HSTS upgrades for sub-resource requests. Doing so makes it infeasible for third-party sites to use the HSTS cache in order to track users across the web.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Interoperable pointerrawupdate events exposed only in secure contexts

The PointerEvents spec restricted pointerrawupdate to secure contexts in 2020, hiding both the event firing and the global event listeners from insecure contexts.  Through this feature, Chrome will match the updated spec and become interoperable with other major browsers.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Sticky user activation across same-origin navigations

This feature preserves the sticky user activation state after a page navigates to another same-origin page.  The lack of user activation in the post-navigation page prevents some use cases like showing virtual keyboards on auto-focus, and this has been a blocker for the developers who want to build MPAs over SPAs.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support `download` attribute in SVG &lt;a&gt; element 

This feature introduces support for the download attribute on the SVGAElement interface in Chromium, aligning with the SVG 2 specification. The download attribute enables authors to specify that the target of an SVG hyperlink should be downloaded rather than navigated to, mirroring the behavior already supported in HTMLAnchorElement. This enhancement promotes interoperability across major browsers and ensures consistent behavior between HTML and SVG link elements, thereby improving developer experience and user expectations.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support width and height as presentation attributes for &lt;use&gt; element

This feature enables support for applying width and height to the <use> element using both presentation attributes and CSS properties.

Previously, Chromium only supported setting width and height on <use> via CSS. Presentation attributes were ignored or inconsistently applied, leading to rendering differences and developer confusion.

With this update:
Presentation attributes (width, height) are now supported on <use>.
Viewport resolution now prioritizes the <use> element’s dimensions over those defined in the referenced <symbol> or nested <svg>.

This ensures consistent rendering regardless of whether developers use CSS or markup-based styling.

Using CSS:
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80px" height="80px">
      <rect width="100px" height="100px" fill="green"/>
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" style="width:40px; height:40px"/>
</svg>

Using Presentation Attributes:
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80px" height="80px">
      <rect width="100px" height="100px" fill="green"/>
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" width="40px" height="40px"/>
</svg>

Both now produce the same visual result, which was not guaranteed before this change.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web App Manifest: specify update eligibility, icon urls are Cache-Control: immutable

Specify an update eligibility algorithm in the manifest spec. This makes the update process more deterministic and predictable, giving the dev more control over whether (and when) updates should apply to existing installations, and allowing removal of the 'update check throttle' that user agents currently need to implement to avoid wasting network resources.

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web Speech API contextual biasing

This feature enables websites to support contextual biasing for speech recognition by adding a recognition phrase list to the Web Speech API.

Developers can provide a list of phrases as well as updating them to apply a bias to the speech recognition models in favor of those phrases. This helps improve accuracy and relevance for domain-specific and personalized speech recognition.
