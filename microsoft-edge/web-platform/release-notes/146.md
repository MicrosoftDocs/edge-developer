<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## CSS features

Below are the new Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) features in Microsoft Edge.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS update: decoupling of Width and Style properties

The behavior of `border-width`, `outline-width`, and `column-rule-width` properties has been updated to align with the latest CSS specifications.

Previously, if the corresponding `border-style`, `outline-style`, or `column-rule-style` property was set to `none` or `hidden`, the computed width would be forced to `0px` regardless of the value you specified.

Now, the computed values of `border-width`, `outline-width`, and `column-rule-width` always reflect your specified values, independent of the corresponding `*-style` property. The resolved values returned by `getComputedStyle()` for `outline-width` and `column-rule-width` also reflect the values you specified.

See also:
* [border-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/border-width) at MDN.
* [outline-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/outline-width) at MDN.
* [column-rule-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/column-rule-width) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Scroll-triggered animations

Scroll-triggered animations let you control animations based on scroll position. You can play, pause, or reset an animation when a certain scroll position is reached.

This feature eliminates the need to use JavaScript to manually detect when an element is in view and then trigger animations. Instead, you can define scroll-based animations declaratively in CSS, which allows the browser to optimize performance by running the animations on a worker thread.

See also:
* [Timeline Triggers](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/#timeline-triggers) in _CSS Animations Module Level 2_.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `hanging` and `each-line` keywords for `text-indent`

The `text-indent` property now supports two optional keywords:

* `hanging`: Indents all lines except the first line.
* `each-line`: Applies indentation to each line after a forced line break, not just the first line.

These keywords give you more control over how text indentation is applied in different scenarios.

See also:
* [text-indent](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/text-indent) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Timeline named range `"scroll"`

In scroll-driven animations, view timelines now support a `"scroll"` named range in addition to the existing named ranges (`"entry"`, `"exit"`, `"cover"`, `"contain"`).

The new `"scroll"` range refers to the full extent of the scroll container, rather than just the portion where the animation subject is visible. This gives you more control over when animations start and stop within the scrollable area.

See also:
* [animation-range](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation-range) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `trigger-scope`

The `trigger-scope` property lets you control the scope of animation trigger names, similar to how anchor scoping works with the `anchor-scope` property.

Trigger names declared by properties like `timeline-trigger` are global by default, which can lead to naming conflicts. Use `trigger-scope` to limit the visibility of trigger names to a specific scope and prevent unintended animations from being triggered.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `meta name="text-scale"` element

The `<meta name="text-scale" content="scale">` meta element makes your page's default font size scale with the user's operating system and browser text scale settings.

This is useful if your page uses font-relative units like `rem` and `em`. The meta element tells the browser that your page is built to scale well with different text size preferences, so the browser can disable its own text auto-sizing mechanisms.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web APIs

Below are the new Web API features in Microsoft Edge.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### MIME type parameters are preserved in data URLs

When you use data URLs, MIME type parameters (such as `charset` or `boundary`) are now preserved in the `Content-Type` header.

This change aligns data URL handling with the Fetch Standard and ensures that parameter information in data URLs is not lost during processing.

See also:
* [data: URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `Intl.Locale.prototype.variants`

The `Intl.Locale.prototype.variants` property returns the variants associated with a locale as a string of dash-separated identifiers.

You can also now pass `"variants"` in the options object when constructing an `Intl.Locale`.

See also:
* [Intl.Locale.prototype.variants](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/variants) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Iterator Sequencing

The `Iterator.concat()` method creates a new iterator by combining multiple iterators in sequence.

You can pass any number of iterables to `Iterator.concat()`, and the resulting iterator will yield values from each iterable in order.

See also:
* [Iterator.concat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator/concat) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### JSON and style support for `link rel=modulepreload`

You can now use `<link rel="modulepreload">` to preload JSON and CSS modules in addition to JavaScript modules.

Specify the module type using the `as` attribute:
* `<link rel="modulepreload" as="style" href="...">`  for CSS modules
* `<link rel="modulepreload" as="json" href="...">`  for JSON modules

This brings feature parity across different module types for preloading.

See also:
* [rel="modulepreload"](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/modulepreload) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Playback Statistics API for WebAudio

The `AudioContext.playbackStats` property provides statistics about your web audio playback, such as average latency, minimum/maximum latency, underrun duration, and underrun count.

Use this API to monitor audio quality and detect glitches in your audio playback.

This feature was previously called `AudioContext.playoutStats`. It has been renamed to `AudioContext.playbackStats` to align with the final Web Audio API specification. The old name is still available as a deprecated alias for backward compatibility.

See also:
* [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Preserving `dropEffect` values from `dragover` to `drop` events

When using the Drag and Drop API, the `dropEffect` value set in a `dragover` event is now preserved and available in the subsequent `drop` event.

Previously, the browser would overwrite the `dropEffect` value with its own negotiated operation, which prevented developers from controlling the visual feedback and the final operation performed.

See also:
* [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) at MDN.
* [DataTransfer: dropEffect property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/dropEffect) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Sanitizer API

The Sanitizer API provides a simple and safe way to remove unsafe HTML content from user-supplied HTML strings.

Use this API to sanitize HTML input and reduce the risk of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks when displaying user-generated content.

See also:
* [HTML Sanitizer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTML_Sanitizer_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### `path` attribute on SVG `<textPath>` element

The `<textPath>` SVG element now supports a `path` attribute, which lets you define text path geometry inline using SVG path data.

Instead of always needing to reference a separate `<path>` element with the `href` attribute, you can now include the path data directly in the `<textPath>` element's `path` attribute.

When both `path` and `href` are specified, the `path` attribute takes precedence.

See also:
* [&lt;textPath&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/textPath) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web app scope system accent color

The `accent-color: auto` CSS property is now scoped to only work within installed web apps, aligning with the existing `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` CSS system color keywords.

Previously, when `accent-color` was set to `auto`, form controls would adopt the system accent color in all contexts (both web pages and installed web apps). This change ensures that system accent colors are only available in installed web app contexts, providing more consistent developer and user expectations while adhering to fingerprinting restrictions.

See also:
* [accent-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/accent-color) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Device Memory API limits

The Device Memory API now reports updated values that better reflect modern device capabilities:

* Android devices: 1, 2, 4, or 8 GB
* Other platforms: 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 GB

These new values replace the outdated values (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 GB), which reduce fingerprinting risk and provide better segmentation for high-end devices.

See also:
* [Device Memory API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Device_Memory_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU Compatibility mode

Adds an opt-in, lightly restricted subset of the WebGPU API capable of running older graphics APIs such as OpenGL and Direct3D11. By opting into this mode and obeying its constraints, developers can extend the reach of their WebGPU applications to many older devices that do not have the modern, explicit graphics APIs that core WebGPU requires. For simple applications, the only required change is to specify the `"compatibility"` featureLevel when calling `requestAdapter()`. For more advanced applications, some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the mode's restrictions. Since Compatibility mode is a subset, the resulting applications are also valid WebGPU Core applications and will run even on user agents that do not support Compatibility mode.

See also:
* [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API), at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU: Texture and Sampler `let` binding

WGSL now supports storing texture and sampler objects in `let` declarations via the `texture_and_sampler_let` language feature.

This allows for more flexible shader code organization and reuse of texture and sampler bindings.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### WebGPU: Transient attachments

The new `TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT` GPU texture usage flag allows developers to create render pass attachments that can stay in tile memory, avoiding VRAM traffic and potentially avoiding VRAM allocation for the textures.

When a texture is declared as transient (or "memoryless"), the GPU knows that the contents of that texture are only needed temporarily within the current render pass. Since the texture contents are discarded after the render pass, the driver may not even need to allocate space for that texture in the main VRAM. Even without hardware support for transient attachments, this hint can be used to reuse texture allocations between passes, reducing peak memory usage.

See also:
* [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) at MDN.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Always negotiate data channels in WebRTC

The new `alwaysNegotiateDataChannels` option for `RTCPeerConnection` allows you to negotiate data channels in the SDP offer before creating a data channel. The data channel m-line is placed before any audio or video m-lines.

Use this option when creating a peer connection to ensure data channels are always negotiated:

```javascript
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection({
  alwaysNegotiateDataChannels: true
});
const offer = await pc.createOffer();
```

See also:
* [RTCPeerConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Populate `targetURL` during file handling

When a Progressive Web App (PWA) is launched via file handling, the `LaunchParams.targetURL` property is now properly populated in the launch queue.

Previously, this property was `null` when a file launch was directed to an existing window. Now, the URL from the developer's manifest `action` field is available to the `launchQueue` consumer, providing consistency with other launch triggers like shortcut launches and navigation capturing. This allows developers to better understand the intent of the launch and handle specific routing logic even when the primary payload is a set of file handles.

See also:
* [Web App Launch Handler API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Launch_Handler_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Stop re-queueing `LaunchParams` on reload

The `launchQueue` no longer re-sends the last `LaunchParams` (including file handles) when a user reloads the page in a PWA.

Previously, a page refresh would trigger the launch consumer again with data from the original launch, which often led to unexpected behavior. For example, an app might prompt users to "save changes" or "overwrite file" every time they refreshed the page. This change ensures that a reload is treated as a standard navigation rather than a "re-launch," and the `launchQueue` will only be populated when a new file launch event actually occurs.

See also:
* [Web App Launch Handler API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Launch_Handler_API) at MDN.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### PrerenderUntilScript

Expires on September 8, 2026.

This origin trial introduces `prerender_until_script`, a new action for the Speculation Rules API that provides a middle ground between `prefetch` and `prerender`.

Use this action when you want the browser to prerender a page, but stop and switch back to prefetching once a specific script starts executing.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### UserMediaElement

Expires on July 14, 2026.

This origin trial introduces the `<usermedia>` HTML element, a browser-controlled element for requesting camera or microphone access.

Using a semantic HTML element instead of JavaScript provides better clarity to users about the permission request, improves accessibility, and prevents manipulative UI patterns. The element also streamlines the workflow by directly providing the media stream to your application, eliminating the need for separate API calls.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Local Network Access from non-secure contexts

Expires on May 19, 2026.

Local Network Access from non-secure contexts temporarily allows for access to resources on local networks to originate from non-secure contexts.  This gives you more time to migrate Local Network Access requests so that they originate from a secure context.

For restrictions on Local Network Access, see [New permission prompt for Local Network Access](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/local-network-access).  This origin trial can only be enabled through HTTP header-provided origin tokens.
