<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edge DevTools

See [What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 139)](../../devtools/whats-new/2025/08/devtools-139.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## WebView2

See [1.0.3405.78](../../webview2/release-notes/index.md#10340578) (Aug. 2025) in _Release Notes for the WebView2 SDK_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS custom functions

A CSS custom function is similar to a custom property, but instead of returning a single, fixed value, a CSS custom function returns values that are based on other custom properties, parameters, and conditionals.

The following example shows a custom function called `--negative`, which takes a single parameter `--value` and returns its negated value:

```css
@function --negative(--value) {
  result: calc(-1 * var(--value));
}
```

See also:
* [Defining Custom Functions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-mixins-1/#defining-custom-functions) in the _CSS Functions and Mixins Module_ specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `font-width` property

The `font-width` CSS property selects a font face from a font family based on width, either by a keyword such as `condensed` or a percentage.

The `font-width` property now works both in inline CSS styles and `@font-face` rules.

In addition, the `font-stretch` CSS property is now considered a legacy alias to the `font-width` property.  The `font-stretch` CSS property continues to function, but it's no longer the recommended approach for controlling font width.

See also:
* [Font property descriptors: the font-style, font-weight, and font-width descriptors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/#font-prop-desc) in _CSS Fonts Module Level 4_.
* [font-stretch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-stretch) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Continue running transitions when switching to initial transition value

CSS transitions that are set to `none`, while running, now continue to run.  When transition-related CSS properties change, those changes only affect newly started transitions.

This change makes Microsoft Edge consistent with other browsers.  Previously, Microsoft Edge incorrectly canceled transitions when the `transition` property was set to `none`.

See also:
* [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/transition) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `corner-shape` property

The `corner-shape` CSS property allows you to specify the shape of the corners of an element, in addition to the existing `border-radius` property.

This allows to create shapes like _squircles_ (squared-off circles) or notches, and animating between them.

See also:
* [Corner Shaping: the corner-shape property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-borders-4/#corner-shaping) in _CSS Borders and Box Decorations Module Level 4_.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `request-close` invoker command

The `<dialog>` element's `requestClose()` method can now also be invoked declaratively, by using the `request-close` invoker command.

The `requestClose()` method and the `request-close` invoker command are used to request closing a dialog element, which fires an event that allows you to prevent the dialog from closing, if necessary.

See also:
* [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Audio level for WebRTC encoded frames

The `audioLevel` value for an encoded frame transmitted via RTCPeerConnection is now available in the metadata of that frame.

The `audioLevel` value is already exposed in other APIs, such as RTCStats and RTCContributingSources, and is useful in cases such as to indicate who's talking in a video conferencing application, or to detect silence.

Having `audioLevel` as part of each frame's metadata makes detecting the audio level more accurate and efficient for applications that use WebRTC Encode Transform.  An application no longer needs to constantly call `getStats()` or `getContributingSources()` to get access to the audio level.  The audio level now exactly corresponds to the frame that's being processed.

See also:
* [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Specify a `crash-reporting` endpoint to receive only crash reports

With the Reporting API, crash reports are delivered to the `default` endpoint, which also receives many other kinds of reports besides crash reports.

You can now specify an endpoint named `crash-reporting`, which will receive only crash reports.

See also:
* [Reporting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API)
* [Crash Reports Delivery Priority](https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/#crash-reports-delivery-priority) in _Crash Reporting_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Fire error event instead of throwing for CSP blocked worker

Previously, when a Content Security Policy (CSP) blocked Microsoft Edge from using a Worker or SharedWorker, the browser threw a `SecurityError` when `new Worker(url)` or `new SharedWorker(url)` were run.

Now, the CSP is checked as part of fetching the Worker or SharedWorker script and an error event is fired asynchronously instead of throwing an exception.

See also:
* [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) at MDN.
* [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Reduce fingerprinting in `Accept-Language`

To reduce the amount of information that the `Accept-Language` header exposes in HTTP requests, instead of sending the full list of the user's preferred languages with every HTTP request, only the user's most preferred language is sent.

See also:
* [Accept-Language header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Browser Bound Keys in the Secure Payment Confirmation API

The Secure Payment Confirmation API can now keep up with syncing passkeys and device requirements for online payments.  The Browser Bound Keys feature adds device binding in the browser, to enable payment scenarios in which device binding is required.

This feature helps meet requirements for device binding for payment transactions.

See also:
* [Using Secure Payment Confirmation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API/Using_secure_payment_confirmation) at MDN.
* [Browser Bound Key Store](https://w3c.github.io/secure-payment-confirmation/#sctn-browser-bound-key-store) in _Secure Payment Confirmation_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Better JSON MIME type detection

Microsoft Edge now recognizes all valid JSON MIME types that are defined by the MIME Sniffing specification.  This includes any MIME type whose subtype ends with `+json`, such as `text/html+json`, in addition to `application/json` and `text/json` MIME types.

This change ensures that web APIs and features that rely on JSON detection behave consistently across browsers.

See also:
* [MIME Sniffing](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support the `async` attribute for SVG `<script>` elements

The SVG `<script>` element now supports the `async` attribute, similar to the HTML `<script>` element.

The `async` attribute allows scripts to be executed asynchronously, improving the performance and responsiveness of web apps that utilize SVG.

See also:
* [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/script), at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU `core-features-and-limits`

The `core-features-and-limits` feature string is now available, for checking the features that a WebGPU adapter has.

```javascript
const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
const hasCore = adapter.features.has('core-features-and-limits');
```

The `core-features-and-limits` feature signifies that the WebGPU adapter supports _core_ WebGPU, as opposed to compatibility mode WebGPU.

Currently, core WebGPU is the only available version of WebGPU, but a compatibility mode might be added in the future to allow older hardware to access WebGPU.

See also:
* [WebGPU 'core-features-and-limits' explainer](https://gist.github.com/greggman/0dea9995e33393c546a4c2bd2a12e50e)
* [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU: 3D texture support for BC and ASTC compressed formats

The `texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d` and `texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d` WebGPU features add support for 3D textures that use Block Compression (BC) and Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) formats.

`texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d` and `texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d` let you use the efficient compression capabilities of BC and ASTC formats for volumetric texture data, offering significant reductions in memory footprint and bandwidth requirements, without substantial loss in visual quality.

By exposing these capabilities as WebGPU features, you can explicitly check for support and provide fallback solutions or alternative rendering paths when necessary.

See also:
* [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) at MDN.
* [GPUAdapter: features property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/GPUAdapter/features) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebXR depth sensing performance improvements

The WebXR API exposes several new mechanisms to customize the behavior of the depth-sensing feature within a WebXR session.  These mechanisms can improve the performance of the generation or consumption of the depth buffer.

By using these new exposed mechanisms, you can:

* Request the raw or smooth depth buffer.
* Request that the runtime stop providing the depth buffer, or resume providing the depth buffer.
* Expose a depth buffer that does not align with the user's view exactly, so that the user agent doesn't need to perform unnecessary re-projection for every frame.

See also:
* [WebXR Device API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### PWA features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

`scope_extensions` is a new web app manifest member that enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.

Scope extensions allow web apps that rely on multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

```json
{
  "name": "Example app",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "origin": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The origins that are listed in the `scope_extensions` member must confirm that they are associated with the web app by hosting a configuration file named `.well-known/web-app-origin-association`.  The file must list the web app's origin:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```

See also:
* [Handle links from other origins by using scope extensions](../../progressive-web-apps/how-to/handle-urls.md#handle-links-from-other-origins-by-using-scope-extensions)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Removed features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove auto-detection of ISO-2022-JP charset in HTML

To improve security, auto-detection of the ISO-2022-JP charset in HTML has been removed.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Origin trials

The following are new experimental APIs that you can try on your own live website for a limited time.

To learn more about origin trials, see [Use origin trials in Microsoft Edge](../../origin-trials/index.md).

To see the full list of available origin trials, see [Microsoft Edge Origin Trials](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### New Chromium origin trials


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Full frame rate render blocking attribute

Expires on March 24, 2026

The new `full-frame-rate` render blocking attribute instructs the browser to render the page at a lower frame rate to reserve resources while parsing critical content. After the critical content has been parsed, the brower restores its normal frame rate.

For example `<link rel="expect" href="#critical-content" blocking="full-frame-rate">` lowers the frame rate of the browser until the `#critical-content` element is parsed.

The `full-frame-rate` render blocking attribute is informational only. The browser may decide to lower the frame rate before parsing a blocking element, for example at the very beginning of the loading phase. The browser may also decide to restore the frame rate before the blocking element list gets empty, for example after a timeout or certain user interactions.

###### AriaNotify API

Expires on October 14, 2025.

The AriaNotify API enables your app to directly tell a screen reader what to say when there's a non-user-initiated change in the content of a webpage.  In the simplest scenario, you call `ariaNotify("foo")` on the document or on an element.
