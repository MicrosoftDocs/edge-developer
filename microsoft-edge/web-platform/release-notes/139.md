<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS custom functions

CSS custom functions are similar to custom properties, but instead of returning a single, fixed value, they return values that are based on other custom properties, parameters, and conditionals.

The following example shows a custom function called `--negative`, which takes a single parameter `--value` and returns its negated value:

```css
@function --negative(--value) {
  result: calc(-1 * var(--value));
}
```

See also:
* [Defining Custom Functions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-mixins-1/#defining-custom-functions) in the _CSS Functions and Mixins Module_ specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `caret-animation` property

Microsoft Edge supports animating the `caret-color` CSS property.  However, when animated, the default blinking behavior of the caret interfered with the animation.

The `caret-animation` property now supports two values:

* `auto`: the default browser blinking behavior occurs.
* `manual`: you control the caret animation.

See also:
* [Animation of the insertion caret: caret-animation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#caret-animation) in _CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `font-width` property

The `font-width` CSS property selects a font face from a font family based on width, either by a keyword such as `condensed` or a percentage.

The `font-width` property now works both in inline CSS styles and `@font-face` rules.

In addition, the `font-stretch` CSS property is now considered a legacy alias to the `font-width` propertyh. While it continues to function, it is no longer the recommended approach for controlling font width.

See also:
* [Font property descriptors: the font-style, font-weight, and font-width descriptors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/#font-prop-desc) in _CSS Fonts Module Level 4_.
* [font-stretch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-stretch) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Continue running transitions when switching to initial transition value

This change makes Microsoft Edge consistent with other browsers by letting CSS transitions that are set to `none`, while running, continue to run.

Previously, Edge incorrectly canceled transitions when the `transition` property was set to `none`. When transition-related CSS properties change, those changes are only supposed to affect newly started transitions.

See also:
* [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/transition) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `corner-shape` property

The `corner-shape` CSS property allows you to specify the shape of the corners of an element, in addition to the existing `border-radius` property.

This allows to create shapes like squircles or notches and animating between them.

See also:
* [Corner Shaping: the corner-shape property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-borders-4/#corner-shaping) in _CSS Borders and Box Decorations Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support `width` and `height` presentational attributes on nested `<svg>` elements

You can now use the `width` and `height` presentational attributes on nested `<svg>` elements through both SVG markup and CSS. This approach provides greater flexibility, allowing you to style SVG elements more efficiently within complex designs.

With this feature the two following html code snippets now have the same output:

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
  <svg style="width:50px;height:50px;">
    <circle cx="50px" cy="50px" r="40px" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</svg>
```

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
  <svg width="50px" height="50px">
    <circle cx="50px" cy="50px" r="40px" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</svg>
```

* [`<svg>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/svg) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `request-close` invoker command

The `<dialog>` element's `requestClose()` method can now also be invoked declaratively, by using the `request-close` invoker command.

The `requestClose()` method and the `request-close` invoker command are used to request the closure of a dialog element, which fires an event that allows developers to prevent the dialog from closing if necessary.

See also:
* [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Allow more characters in javascript DOM APIs

You can now create DOM elements and attributes with a wider variety of valid characters and names in JavaScript, matching the behavior for when the same elements and attributes are created in HTML markup.

This change aligns the JavaScript DOM APIs with the HTML parser, which allows a broader set of characters and names for elements and attributes.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Audio level for WebRTC encoded frames

The `audioLevel` value for an encoded frame transmitted via RTCPeerConnection is now available in the metadata of that frame.

The `audioLevel` value is already exposed in other APIs, such as RTCStats and RTCContributingSources, and is useful in cases such as to indicate who's talking in a video conferencing application, or to detect silence.

Having `audioLevel` as part of each frame's metadata makes detecting the audio level more accurate and efficient for applications using WebRTC Encode Transform, which work at the frame level. Applications no longer need to constantly run `getStats()` or `getContributingSources()` to get access to the audio level. The audio level now exactly corresponds to the frame being processed.

See also:
* [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Clear window name for cross-site navigations that switches browsing context group

The value of the window.name property is currently preserved throughout the lifetime of a tab, even with navigation that switches browsing context groups, which can leak information and potentially be used as a tracking vector. Clear the window.name property in this case addresses this issue. This should be a low risk change since looking up a browsing context by name already does not work if it's in another browsing context group, so the name isn't actually useful.

Enterprise Policy: ClearWindowNameCrossSiteBrowsing (will stop working in M142)



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Crash Reporting API: Specify crash-reporting to receive only crash reports

This feature ensures developers receive only crash reports by specifying the endpoint named `crash-reporting `. By default, crash reports are delivered to the `default` endpoint which receives many other kinds of reports besides crash reports. Developers can supply a separate URL to the well-known endpoint named `crash-reporting`, to direct crash reports there, instead of the `default` endpoint. See https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/#crash-reports-delivery-priority.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Fire error event instead of throwing for CSP blocked worker

When blocked by CSP, Chromium currently throws SecurityError from constructor of Worker and SharedWorker. Spec requires CSP to be checked as part of fetch and fires error event asynchronously instead of throwing exception when script runs "new Worker(url)" or "new SharedWorker(url)".
This aims to make Chromium spec conformant, which is not throwing during constructor and fires error event asynchronously.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Private Aggregation API: aggregate error reporting

There are a range of error conditions that can be hit when using the Private Aggregation API. For example, the privacy budget could run out, preventing any further histogram contributions. This feature allows developers to register histogram contributions that should only be sent if a particular type of error occurs.

This feature supports measuring the frequency of the error conditions and to split these measurements on relevant developer-specified dimensions (e.g. version of deployed code). As the errors themselves may be cross-site information, we cannot simply expose them to the page for users without third-party cookies. Instead, this feature reuses the existing aggregate, noised reporting pipelines through the Aggregation Service.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Reduce fingerprinting in Accept-Language header information

We want to reduce the amount of information the Accept-Language header value string exposes in HTTP requests and in navigator.languages. Instead of sending a full list of the user's preferred languages on every HTTP request via the Accept-Language header. We propose only sending the user’s most preferred language in the Accept-Language header. To minimize compatibility risks, we first plan to reduce the information in the HTTP header, and then reduce the related navigator.languages JS getters in the future.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Secure Payment Confirmation: Browser Bound Keys

Adds an additional cryptographic signature over Secure Payment Confirmation assertions and credential creation. The corresponding private key is not synced across devices. This helps web developers meet requirements for device binding for payment transactions.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Spec-compliant JSON MIME type detection

Chromium now recognizes all valid JSON MIME types as defined by the WHATWG mimesniff specification. This includes any MIME type whose subtype ends with “+json”, in addition to the traditional application/json and text/json. This change ensures that web APIs and features relying on JSON detection behave consistently with the web platform standard and other browsers.

A key motivation for this change is to fix JSON module import behavior, where previously valid JSON MIME types like text/html+json and image/svg+json would fail to load as modules.

Draft CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6525687

Related Issues: https://github.com/whatwg/mimesniff/issues/112. The consensus was to retain the broad definition of JSON MIME types—including all */*+json.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support the `async` attribute for SVG `<script>` elements

The SVG `<script>` element now supports the `async` attribute, similar to the HTML `<script>` element.

The `async` attribute allows scripts to be executed asynchronously, improving the performance and responsiveness of web applications that utilize SVG.

* []()


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web App Manifest: specify update eligibility, icon urls are Cache-Control: immutable

Specify an update eligibility algorithm in the manifest spec. This makes the update process more deterministic and predictable, giving the dev more control over whether (and when) updates should apply to existing installations, and allowing removal of the 'update check throttle' that user agents currently need to implement to avoid wasting network resources.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

`scope_extensions` is a new web application manifest member which enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.

Scope extensions allow web apps that rely on multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

```json
{
  "name": "Example app",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "origin": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The origins that are listed in the `scope_extensions` member must confirm that they are associated with the web app by hosting a configuration file named `.well-known/web-app-origin-association`.  The file must list the web app's origin:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU `core-features-and-limits`

The 'core-features-and-limits' feature signifies a WebGPU adapter and device support the core features and limits of the spec.

Explainer:
https://gist.github.com/greggman/0dea9995e33393c546a4c2bd2a12e50e


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU: 3D texture support for BC and ASTC compressed formats

Functionality added to the WebGPU spec after its first shipment in a browser.

The “texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d” and “texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d” WebGPU features add respectively 3D texture support for BC and ASTC compressed formats.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebXR depth sensing performance improvements

The WebXR API now exposes several new mechanisms to customize the behavior of the depth sensing feature within a WebXR session. These mechanisms can imrpove the performance of the generation or consumption of the depth buffer.

The exposed mechanisms are:

* The ability to request the raw or smooth depth buffer.
* The ability to request that the runtime stop or resume providing the depth buffer.
* The ability to expose a depth buffer that does not align with the user's view exactly, so that the user agent doesn't need to perform unnecessary re-projections every frame.
