<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS custom functions

CSS custom functions are similar to custom properties, but instead of returning a single, fixed value, they return values that are based on other custom properties, parameters, and conditionals.

The following example shows a custom function called `--negative`, which takes a single parameter `--value` and returns its negated value:

```css
@function --negative(--value) {
  result: calc(-1 * var(--value));
}
```

See also:
* [Defining Custom Functions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-mixins-1/#defining-custom-functions) in the _CSS Functions and Mixins Module_ specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `caret-animation` property

Microsoft Edge supports animating the `caret-color` CSS property.  However, when animated, the default blinking behavior of the caret interfered with the animation.

The `caret-animation` property now supports two values:

* `auto`: the default browser blinking behavior occurs.
* `manual`: you control the caret animation.

See also:
* [Animation of the insertion caret: caret-animation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#caret-animation) in _CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `font-width` property

The `font-width` CSS property selects a font face from a font family based on width, either by a keyword such as `condensed` or a percentage.

The `font-width` property now works both in inline CSS styles and `@font-face` rules.

In addition, the `font-stretch` CSS property is now considered a legacy alias to the `font-width` propertyh. While it continues to function, it is no longer the recommended approach for controlling font width.

See also:
* [Font property descriptors: the font-style, font-weight, and font-width descriptors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/#font-prop-desc) in _CSS Fonts Module Level 4_.
* [font-stretch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-stretch) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Continue running transitions when switching to initial transition value.

When the transition related properties change, they are only supposed to affect newly started transitions. This means that if you change the transition properties, unless you also change the properties which have active transition animations, those transition animations will continue with the previously specified duration, easing, etc.

Blink incorrectly canceled transitions when the transition property was set to "none", even though it doesn't cancel them if you only change the transition-duration. With this feature, blink will be consistent with webkit and gecko, allowing active transitions to continue running, unless/until their property value changes triggering a new transition update.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Corner shaping (corner-shape, superellipse, squircle)

Enable styling corners, on top of the existing border-radius,
by specifying the shape/curvature of the corner.

This allows shapes like squircles, notches, scoops etc., and animating between them.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Short-circuiting var() and attr()

When the fallback is not taken, var()/attr() functions evaluate without looking for cycles in that fallback.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support width and height as presentation attributes on nested &lt;svg&gt; elements

This feature supports applying width and height as presentation attributes on nested `<svg>` elements through both SVG markup and CSS. This dual approach provides even greater flexibility for developers, allowing them to manage and style SVG elements more efficiently within complex designs.

With this feature the below two html will now have the same output:

With CSS Properties for nested `<svg>` element:

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
  <svg style="width:50px;height:50px;">
    <circle cx="50px" cy="50px" r="40px" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</svg>
```

Without CSS Properties for nested `<svg>` element:

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
  <svg width="50px" height="50px">
    <circle cx="50px" cy="50px" r="40px" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</svg>
```


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `request-close` Invoker Command

Dialog elements can be closed through a variety of mechanisms, sometimes developers want to have the ability to prevent closure. To achieve this dialogs fire a cancel event. Originally this was only fired via a close request (e.g. ESC key press), recently a `requestClose()` JS function was added which also fires the cancel event.

The 'request-close' command brings that new ability to the declarative invoker commands API.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Allow more characters in javascript DOM APIs

The HTML parser has always (or for a long time) allowed elements and attributes to have a wide variety of valid characters and names, but the javascript DOM APIs to create the same elements and attributes are more strict and don't match the parser.

This change relaxes the validation of the javascript DOM APIs to match the HTML parser.

More context here: https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/849

I don't anticipate any compat issues from this change because all of the previously allowed element/attribute names are still allowed with the new behavior.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Audio Level for RTC Encoded Frames

This feature consists in exposing to the Web the audio level of an encoded frame transmitted via RTCPeerConnection and exposed using WebRTC Encoded Transform.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Clear window name for cross-site navigations that switches browsing context group

The value of the window.name property is currently preserved throughout the lifetime of a tab, even with navigation that switches browsing context groups, which can leak information and potentially be used as a tracking vector. Clear the window.name property in this case addresses this issue. This should be a low risk change since looking up a browsing context by name already does not work if it's in another browsing context group, so the name isn't actually useful.

Enterprise Policy: ClearWindowNameCrossSiteBrowsing (will stop working in M142)



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Crash Reporting API: Specify crash-reporting to receive only crash reports

This feature ensures developers receive only crash reports by specifying the endpoint named `crash-reporting `. By default, crash reports are delivered to the `default` endpoint which receives many other kinds of reports besides crash reports. Developers can supply a separate URL to the well-known endpoint named `crash-reporting`, to direct crash reports there, instead of the `default` endpoint. See https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/#crash-reports-delivery-priority.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Fire error event instead of throwing for CSP blocked worker

When blocked by CSP, Chromium currently throws SecurityError from constructor of Worker and SharedWorker. Spec requires CSP to be checked as part of fetch and fires error event asynchronously instead of throwing exception when script runs "new Worker(url)" or "new SharedWorker(url)".
This aims to make Chromium spec conformant, which is not throwing during constructor and fires error event asynchronously.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### On-device Web Speech API

This feature adds on-device speech recognition support to the Web Speech API, allowing websites to ensure that neither audio nor transcribed speech are sent to a third-party service for processing.

Websites can query the availability of on-device speech recognition for specific languages, prompt users to install the necessary resources for on-device speech recognition, and choose between on-device or cloud-based speech recognition as needed.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Private Aggregation API: aggregate error reporting

There are a range of error conditions that can be hit when using the Private Aggregation API. For example, the privacy budget could run out, preventing any further histogram contributions. This feature allows developers to register histogram contributions that should only be sent if a particular type of error occurs.

This feature supports measuring the frequency of the error conditions and to split these measurements on relevant developer-specified dimensions (e.g. version of deployed code). As the errors themselves may be cross-site information, we cannot simply expose them to the page for users without third-party cookies. Instead, this feature reuses the existing aggregate, noised reporting pipelines through the Aggregation Service.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Reduce fingerprinting in Accept-Language header information

We want to reduce the amount of information the Accept-Language header value string exposes in HTTP requests and in navigator.languages. Instead of sending a full list of the user's preferred languages on every HTTP request via the Accept-Language header. We propose only sending the user’s most preferred language in the Accept-Language header. To minimize compatibility risks, we first plan to reduce the information in the HTTP header, and then reduce the related navigator.languages JS getters in the future.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Secure Payment Confirmation: Browser Bound Keys

Adds an additional cryptographic signature over Secure Payment Confirmation assertions and credential creation. The corresponding private key is not synced across devices. This helps web developers meet requirements for device binding for payment transactions.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Secure Payment Confirmation: UX Refresh

Updates the UX elements for the SPC dialog on Android Chrome.

Other than just UX presentation the following are being added:
- Allowing merchants to provide an optional list of payment entity logos related to the payment that will be displayed in the UX (https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation/pull/294).
- Returning different output states back to the merchant depending on whether the user wants to continue the transaction without SPC or to cancel the transaction (https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation/pull/292). Currently, we only send a single output state back for both cases.
- A new payment detail label field will be added to the payment instrument so the text be presented across 2 lines in SPC (https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation/pull/298)



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Spec-compliant JSON MIME type detection

Chromium now recognizes all valid JSON MIME types as defined by the WHATWG mimesniff specification. This includes any MIME type whose subtype ends with “+json”, in addition to the traditional application/json and text/json. This change ensures that web APIs and features relying on JSON detection behave consistently with the web platform standard and other browsers.

A key motivation for this change is to fix JSON module import behavior, where previously valid JSON MIME types like text/html+json and image/svg+json would fail to load as modules.

Draft CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6525687

Related Issues: https://github.com/whatwg/mimesniff/issues/112. The consensus was to retain the broad definition of JSON MIME types—including all */*+json.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support async attribute for SVG &lt;script&gt; element

The SVGScriptElement interface in SVG 2.0 introduces the async attribute, similar to the HTMLScriptElement. This attribute allows scripts to be executed asynchronously, improving the performance and responsiveness of web applications that utilize SVG.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web App Manifest: specify update eligibility, icon urls are Cache-Control: immutable

Specify an update eligibility algorithm in the manifest spec. This makes the update process more deterministic and predictable, giving the dev more control over whether (and when) updates should apply to existing installations, and allowing removal of the 'update check throttle' that user agents currently need to implement to avoid wasting network resources.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

Adds a "scope_extensions" web app manifest field that enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.  

Example usage:

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {"type" : "origin", "origin" : "https://example.com"}
  ]
}
```

This allows sites that control multiple subdomains and top level domains to be presented as a single web app. 

Requires listed origins to confirm association with the web app using a .well-known/web-app-origin-association configuration file.

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU `core-features-and-limits`

The 'core-features-and-limits' feature signifies a WebGPU adapter and device support the core features and limits of the spec.

Explainer:
https://gist.github.com/greggman/0dea9995e33393c546a4c2bd2a12e50e


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU: 3D texture support for BC and ASTC compressed formats

Functionality added to the WebGPU spec after its first shipment in a browser.

The “texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d” and “texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d” WebGPU features add respectively 3D texture support for BC and ASTC compressed formats.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebXR Depth Sensing Performance Improvements

Exposes several new mechanisms to customize the behavior of the depth sensing feature within a WebXR session, with the goal of improving the performance of the generation or consumption of the depth buffer.

The key mechanisms exposed are: the ability to request the raw or smooth depth buffer, the ability to request that the runtime stop or resume providing the depth buffer, and the ability to expose a depth buffer that does not align with the user's view exactly, so that the user agent does not need to perform unnecessary re-projections every frame.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features

**TODO: CHECK THE FEATURES LISTED BELOW AND ADD THEM TO THE SITE-COMPAT-IMPACTING-CHANGES ARTICLE.**

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove auto-detection of ISO-2022-JP charset in HTML

There are known[1] security issues around charset auto-detection for ISO-2022-JP.
Given that the usage is very low, and Safari does not support auto-detection of ISO-2022-JP, we will remove support for it to eliminate the security issues.
