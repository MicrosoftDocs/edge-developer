<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edge DevTools

See [What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 140)](../../devtools/whats-new/2025/09/devtools-140.md).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## WebView2

See [1.0.3485.44](../../webview2/release-notes/index.md#10348544) in _Release Notes for the WebView2 SDK_ (Sep. 2025).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `caret-animation` property

Microsoft Edge supports animating the `caret-color` CSS property.  However, when animated, the default blinking behavior of the caret interfered with the animation.

The `caret-animation` property now supports two values:

* `auto`: The default browser blinking behavior occurs.
* `manual`: You control the caret animation.

See also:
* [Animation of the insertion caret: caret-animation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#caret-animation) in _CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `counter()` and `counters()` in alternative text of the `content` CSS property

The `counter()` and `counters()` CSS functions can now be used in the alternative text portion of the `content` CSS property.

For example:

```css
::before {
  content: url("images/chapter-separator.png") / "Chapter" counter(chapter);
}
```

See also:
* [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/content) at MDN.
* [counter](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/counter) at MDN.
* [counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/counters) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `scroll-target-group` property

The `scroll-target-group: auto` CSS property specifies that the element is a scroll marker group container.

The browser tracks the current scroll marker within scroll marker group containers and allows you to style `<a>` elements by using the `:target-current` pseudo class.

For example, the following snippet shows how to automatically highlight the currently visible chapter within a table of contents:

```html
<style>
  ol {
    right: 10px;
    top: 10px;
    position: fixed;
    scroll-target-group: auto;
  }

  a:target-current {
    color: red;
  }

  .chapter {
    height: 60vh;
    margin: 10px;
  }
</style>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ch1">Chapter 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ch2">Chapter 2</a></li>
</ol>
<div id="intro" class="chapter">Introduction content</div>
<div id="ch1" class="chapter">Chapter 1 content</div>
<div id="ch2" class="chapter">Chapter 2 content</div>
```

* [::scroll-marker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::scroll-marker) at MDN.
* [:target-current](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:target-current) at MDN.
* [The 'scroll target group' property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-overflow-5/#scroll-target-group) in _CSS Overflow Module Level 5_ draft.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS typed arithmetic

Typed arithmetic in CSS allows you to write expressions such as `calc(10em / 1px)` or `calc(20% / 0.5em * 1px)` to get unitless values.  Unitless values can be useful for cases such as typography.

CSS typed arithmetic allows you to convert values with units into unitless values.  You can then use the unitless value in CSS properties that accept numbers, or further multiply the unitless value by a value with another unit, such as to convert a pixels value to a degrees value.

See also:
* [Type Checking](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#calc-type-checking) in _CSS Values and Units Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### View transition `finished` promise timing change

Previously, a view transition's `finished` promise resolved after the visual frame that removes the view transition has been produced by the browser.  This can cause flickering at the end of the view transition, if JavaScript code modifies styles.

The timing of the `finished` promise has now been changed to address this issue.

See also:
* [[css-view-transitions-1] finished promise timing](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12442)
* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### View transitions: more animation properties are inherited

The following CSS animation properties are now inherited by view transition pseudo-elements:

* `animation-timing-function`
* `animation-iteration-count`
* `animation-direction`
* `animation-play-state`
* `animation-delay`

See also:
* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Nested view transitions

Nested view transitions allow view transitions to generate a nested pseudo-element tree rather than a flat pseudo-element tree, which allows certain view transitions to appear more like their original elements.

Some CSS features rely on the relationship between elements in the DOM tree, such as:

* Clipping from the `overflow`, `clip-path`, or `border-radius` properties.
* 3D effects from the `transform`, `transform-style`, or `perspective` properties.
* Masking and effects from the `opacity`, `mask-image`, or `filter` properties.

The visual output of these effects depend on the DOM tree structure, and a view transition that flattens the DOM tree can cause these effects to not work as expected.

See also:
* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.
* [Explainer: Nested View Transition Groups](https://github.com/WICG/view-transitions/blob/main/nested-explainer.md) in the `WICG / view-transitions` GitHub repo.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `font-variation-settings` descriptor in `@font-face` rules

`@font-face` rules now support the `font-variation-settings` property.

The `font-variation-settings` property allows you to adjust a font's weight, width, slant, and other axes on individual elements.  Now, the `font-variation-settings` property can also be used within `@font-face` rule declarations, which can help reduce repetition and make it easier to define typographic styles.

See also:
* [font-variation-settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-variation-settings) at MDN.
* [@font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### SVG features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS width and height support for SVG `<use>` element

The SVG `<use>` element now supports the `width` and `height` CSS properties.

This allows you to control the sizing of SVG elements through CSS, such as to improve their responsiveness.

With this feature, the following two HTML snippets now produce the same output:

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80" height="80">
      <rect width="100" height="100" fill="green" />
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" style="width:40px; height:40px" />
</svg>
```

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
 <defs>
    <symbol id="sym" width="80" height="80">
      <rect width="100" height="100" fill="green" />
    </symbol>
  </defs>
  <use href="#sym" width="40" height="40" />
</svg>
```

See also:
* [`<svg>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/svg) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support `download` attribute in SVG `<a>` element 

The `download` attribute is now supported by SVG `<a>` elements.

The `download` attribute enables you to specify that the target of an SVG hyperlink should be downloaded rather than navigated to.

See also:
* [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/a) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `__Http-` and `__HostHttp-` cookie name prefixes

To distinguish, on the server side, between cookies that were set by the server and the client, the `__Http-` and `__HostHttp-` name prefixes are now available in cookies.

These prefixes can be used to check if a cookie was set on the client-side by using JavaScript code, such as to verify that a cookie that's normally always set by the server was not unexpectedly set by the client.

See also:
* [The "__Http-" Prefix](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies.html#section-4.1.3.3) in _Cookies: HTTP State Management Mechanism_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `overscroll-behavior` propagation from `<html>` to the viewport

Previously, `overscroll-behavior` was propagated from the `<body>` to the viewport of the page.  The `overscroll-behavior` property is now propagated from the root `<html>` element to the viewport.

This aligns Microsoft Edge with other browsers.

See also:
* [overscroll-behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `min` option for `ReadableStreamBYOBReader.read(view)`

The `min` option for the `ReadableStreamBYOBReader.read(view)` API lets you require that the stream wait until at least a minimum number of elements are available before resolving the read operation.

The `ReadableStreamBYOBReader.read(view)` API allows you to supply a buffer view into which stream data is read.  The new `min` option can be used to avoid resolving the stream's read operation with fewer elements than the view can accommodate, which is useful for performance-sensitive applications where consumers often require a minimum number of elements before they can proceed with decoding, parsing, or other processing logic.

See also:
* [ReadableStreamBYOBReader: read() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamBYOBReader/read) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `container` option for `scrollIntoView()`

By default, the `scrollIntoView()` function scrolls every ancestor of the element that's also a scroll container.

The `scrollIntoView()` function now supports a `container` option, which can be used to only scroll the nearest ancestor instead.

For example:

```javascript
slideList.addEventListener('click', event => {
  // scrollIntoView will automatically determine the position.
  event.target.targetSlide.scrollIntoView({container: 'nearest', behavior: 'smooth'});
});
```

See also:
* [Element: scrollIntoView() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Service worker static routing API timings

New service worker static routing API timing information is now available to the navigation and resource timing APIs.  This information allows you to measure the latency that's incurred by the static routing API, such as router evaluation time or time required to conduct cache lookup, or determine if the matched source is the final source used.

The new timing information provides:

* The matched route (the route that the static routing API evaluated).
* The actual source from which the resource was retrieved.
* The time it took to match the route.

See also:
* [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) at MDN.
* [Use the Service Worker Static Routing API to bypass the service worker for specific paths](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/service-worker-static-routing)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### SharedWorker script inherit controllers for Blob URLs

`SharedWorker` instances now inherit controllers for Blob URLs. This makes Microsoft Edge consistent with other browsers.

See also:
* [SharedWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) at MDN.
* [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Popover ToggleEvent `source` attribute

The `source` attribute of a popover's `ToggleEvent` instances now refers to the element which triggered the `ToggleEvent`, if applicable.

For example, if a `<button>` element with the `popovertarget` attribute, or the `commandfor` attribute set up to open a popover, is clicked by the user, then the `ToggleEvent` has a `source` attribute set to the invoking button.

See also:
* [ToggleEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ToggleEvent) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Convert Uint8Array between base64 and hex formats

`Uint8Array` objects have the following new methods to convert between Base64 and Hex data formats:

* `Uint8Array.fromBase64()`
* `Uint8Array.fromHex()`
* `Uint8Array.prototype.toBase64()`
* `Uint8Array.prototype.toHex()`
* `Uint8Array.prototype.setFromBase64()`
* `Uint8Array.prototype.setFromHex()`

See also:
* [Uint8Array to/from base64](https://tc39.es/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/spec/)
* [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `highlightsFromPoint` API

The `highlightsFromPoint` API lets you interact with custom highlights by detecting which highlights exist at a specific point within a document.

The `highlightsFromPoint` API is useful for apps where multiple highlights may overlap or exist within the shadow DOM.  This API makes it possible to manage dynamic interactions that have custom highlights more effectively, such as by responding to user clicks or hover events on highlighted regions, to trigger custom tooltips, context menus, or other interactive features. 

See also:
* [CSS Custom Highlight API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CSS_Custom_Highlight_API) at MDN.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Removed features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Removed special font size rules for `<h1>` within some elements

Previously, special margins and font sizes were applied to `<h1>` elements that were nested within `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` elements.

These special rules are now removed, because they caused accessibility issues, such as visually reducing the font size for nested `<h1>` elements to look like `<h2>` without reflecting this change in the accessibility tree.

See also:
* [`<h1>–<h6>`: The HTML Section Heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements) at MDN.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Origin trials

The following are new experimental APIs which you can try on your own live website for a limited time.

To learn more about origin trials, see [Use origin trials in Microsoft Edge](../../origin-trials/index.md).

To see the full list of available origin trials, see [Microsoft Edge Origin Trials](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Microsoft Edge-only origin trials


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

Expires on August 31, 2025

`scope_extensions` is a new web app manifest member that enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.

Scope extensions allow web apps that rely on multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

```json
{
  "name": "Example app",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "origin": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The origins that are listed in the `scope_extensions` member must confirm that they are associated with the web app, by hosting a configuration file named `.well-known/web-app-origin-association`.  The file must list the web app's origin:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```

<!-- ---------- -->
###### MS High Contrast Deprecation

Expires on September 9, 2025.

The MS High Contrast Deprecation origin trial enables the legacy CSS `-ms-high-contrast` media query and the legacy `-ms-high-contrast-adjust` property.

See [Deprecating support for -ms-high-contrast and -ms-high-contrast-adjust](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/04/29/deprecating-ms-high-contrast/).

<!-- ---------- -->
###### AriaNotify API

Expires on October 14, 2025.

The AriaNotify API enables your app to directly tell a screen reader what to say when there's a non-user-initiated change in the content of a webpage.  In the simplest scenario, you call `ariaNotify("foo")` on the document or on an element.

See [Creating a more accessible web with Aria Notify](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/05/05/creating-a-more-accessible-web-with-aria-notify/).
