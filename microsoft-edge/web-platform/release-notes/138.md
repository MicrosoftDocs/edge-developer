<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `stretch` sizing keyword

The `stretch` keyword, for CSS sizing properties such as `width` and `height`, allows an element to grow to exactly fill its containing block's available space.  The `stretch` sizing keyword is similar to the value `100%`, except that the resulting size is applied to the element's margin box, instead of being applied to the box that's indicated by `box-sizing`.

The `stretch` keyword allows the element to keep its margins, while still being as large as possible.  This is an unprefixed version of `-webkit-fill-available`.

See also:
* [stretch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/height#stretch) in _height_, at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `abs()` and `sign()` functions

The `abs(A)` function returns the absolute value of _A_, of the same type as the input:

* If _A_'s numeric value is positive or 0⁺, `abs(A)` outputs _A_.
* Otherwise, `abs(A)` outputs -1 * _A_.

The `sign(A)` function returns:

* -1 if _A_'s numeric value is negative.
* +1 if _A_'s numeric value is positive.
* 0⁺ if _A_'s numeric value is 0⁺.
* 0⁻ if _A_'s numeric value is 0⁻.

The return CSS type is `<number>`, made consistent with the input calculation's type.

See also:
* [abs()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/abs) at MDN.
* [sign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/sign) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS environment variable for OS-level font scale

The `preferred-text-scale` CSS environment variable exposes a user's preferred font scale to CSS.

Previously, it was not practical for a page to detect if the user had changed their preferred font size via the operating system's preferences.

See also:
* [env()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/env) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `sibling-index()` and `sibling-count()` functions

`sibling-index()` and `sibling-count()` can be used as integers in CSS property values to style elements based on their position among sibling elements, or on the total number of siblings.  These functions can be used inside `calc()` expressions, or can be used directly as integer values.

For example, you can use the `sibling-index()` function inside a `calc()` expression to set the left margin of a list item based on its position among its siblings:

```css
li {
  margin-inline-start: calc(1rem * sibling-index());
}
```

See also:
* [Tree Counting Functions: the `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()` notations](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/#tree-counting) in the _CSS Values and Units Module Level 5_ specification.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Interpolation progress: CSS `progress()` function

The `progress()` CSS math function returns a `<number>` that represents the position of a value between a progress start value and progress end value.

`progress()` can be useful in cases such as fluid typography.

See also:
* [Interpolation Progress Calculations: the `progress()` notation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/#progress) in the _CSS Values and Units Module Level 5_ specification.
* [[css-values] Proposal for a 'progress' function to calculate progress between two `<length>` values](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7268) on the CSS Working Group GitHub repo.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Prompt and Writing Assistance API developer previews

The Prompt API and Writing Assistance APIs are now available as developer previews in Edge Canary and Dev channels.

These APIs give you access to a powerful small language model, Phi-4-mini, that is built into the Edge browser.

Use these APIs to try out prompt engineering, summarize and modify content, or generate text.

See also:
* [Prompt a built-in language model with the Prompt API](../prompt-api.md)
* [Summarize, write, and rewrite text with the Writing Assistance APIs](../writing-assistance-apis.md)
* [Simplified access to AI in Microsoft Edge: Introducing the Prompt and Writing Assistance APIs](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/05/19/introducing-the-prompt-and-writing-assistance-apis/)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### New `prefetchCache` and `prerenderCache` values for the `Clear-Site-Data` header

The `Clear-Site-Data` HTTP header now supports the new `prefetchCache` and `prerenderCache` values.

Previously, the only way to clear the prefetch and prerender cache was by using `cache` value of the `Clear-Site-Data` HTTP header.  With the increased adoption of the Speculation Rules API, developers need a way to specifically clear the prefetch or prerender cache, or both, without disrupting other session information, such as history or cookies.

See also:
* [Speculation Rules API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Video frame orientation metadata in WebCodecs

Various video-related interfaces in WebCodecs now have `rotation` and `flip` values:

* The `VideoFrame` interface can now create object instances that have arbitrary `rotation` and `flip` values.
* The `VideoDecoderConfig` object now has `rotation` and `flip` fields that are emitted on decoded `VideoFrame` objects automatically.
* The `VideoEncoder` class now has a mechanism for passing `rotation` and `flip` information from `encode()` to the `VideoDecoderConfig` that's emitted as part of `EncodedVideoChunkMetadata`.

Previously, developers had no way of knowing when they received video frames that had a non-default orientation.

See also:
* [WebCodecs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### New `is_top_level` and `visibility_state` fields in Crash Reporting API reports

Crash reports that are sent to default endpoints by the Crash Reporting API now have the `is_top_level` and `visibility_state` string fields.

The `is_top_level` and `visibility_state` fields are contextual bits of information about crashing frames in a crash report.

See also:
* [Reporting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Disallow plain text pre-rendering over HTTP

To make pre-rendering consistent with pre-fetch, plain text pre-rendering now only works over HTTPS.

Previously, plain text pre-rendering was permitted over both HTTP and HTTPS connections.

See also:
* [Navigation fetch changes](https://wicg.github.io/nav-speculation/prerendering.html#navigate-fetch-patch) in _Prerendering Revamped_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Escape `<` and `>` in HTML attributes when serializing

The `<` and `>` characters in HTML element attribute values are now escaped when serializing HTML.  This mitigates the risk of mutation XSS attacks, which occur when the value of an attribute is interpreted as a start tag token after being serialized and re-parsed.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `Integrity-Policy` header for subresource integrity of scripts

The new `Integrity-Policy` header enables you to assert that every resource of a given type needs to be integrity-checked.  If a resource of the specified type is attempted to be loaded without integrity metadata, that attempt fails, and produces a violation report.

See also:
* [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Predictable reported storage quota

The storage quota that's reported by the StorageManager's `estimate()` method for sites that don't have unlimited storage permissions is now the same across all browsing modes.

This mitigates an issue where it was previously possible to detect a user's browsing mode via the reported storage quota, because the storage space that's made available is significantly smaller in InPrivate mode than in regular mode.

The reported quota is now equal to the current storage usage plus the minimum value between 10 GiB and the device disk size rounded up to the nearest 1 GiB, in all browsing modes, for sites with limited storage permissions.

Sites that have unlimited storage permissions are unaffected.

See also:
* [StorageManager](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/StorageManager) at MDN.
* [Storage quotas and eviction criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_API/Storage_quotas_and_eviction_criteria) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `pushsubscriptionchange` event upon resubscription

The `pushsubscriptionchange` event is fired by a service worker when an origin is re-granted notification permission, after the origin's previous push subscription was revoked because of a permission change (from `granted` to `deny` or `default`).

The event is fired with an empty `oldSubscription` and `newSubscription`.

See also:
* [ServiceWorkerGlobalScope: pushsubscriptionchange event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/pushsubscriptionchange_event) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Speculation rules: `target_hint` field

The syntax for speculation rules has been extended to allow you to specify the `target_hint` field.  The `target_hint` field provides a hint for the browser to know where a prerendered target will be displayed, such as in a new tab or window.

For example, when `_blank` is specified as a hint, a prerendered page can be rendered in a window that's opened by `window.open()`.

`target_hint` currently supports the `_self` and `_blank` strings.  If the hint is not specified, it's treated as `_self`.

The `target_hint` field has no effect on prefetching speculation rules.

See also:
* [Speculation Rules API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Viewport Segments Enumeration API

The Viewport Segments Enumeration API allows you to adapt your website layout to target foldable devices.

A viewport segment defines the position and dimensions of a logically separate region of the viewport.  A viewport segment is created when the viewport is split by one or more hardware features (such as a fold or a hinge between separate displays) that act as a divider.

Segments are the regions of the viewport that can be treated as logically distinct.

See also:
* [Feature: Viewport Segments Enumeration API](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5170498990243840)


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

The new `"scope_extensions"` web app manifest field enables a web app to extend its scope to other origins.

Example usage:

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {"type" : "origin", "origin" : "https://example.com"}
  ]
}
```

The `scope_extensions` field allows a site that controls multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

The `scope_extensions` field requires listed origins to confirm association with the web app by using a `.well-known/web-app-origin-association` configuration file:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```

See also:
* [Handle links from other origins by using scope extensions](../../progressive-web-apps/how-to/handle-urls.md#handle-links-from-other-origins-by-using-scope-extensions) in _Handle links to a PWA_.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Removed features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Asynchronous range removal for Media Source Extensions now throws exceptions

The following changes have been made to the Media Source Extensions specification, to disallow ambiguously defined behavior involving asynchronous range removals:

* `SourceBuffer.abort()` no longer aborts `SourceBuffer.remove()` operations.
* Setting `MediaSource.duration` can no longer truncate currently buffered media.

While these changes were made a long time ago, and Safari and Firefox have already implemented them, Chromium had not yet done so.  Exceptions will now be thrown in both of these cases.

See also:
* [Media Source API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove the automatic SwiftShader fallback

Previously, if a WebGL context could not be created with the available GPU, Chromium would automatically fall back to using the SwiftShader software renderer.  This automatic fallback behavior is now removed and the WebGL context creation will now fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader.

SwiftShader poses security risks and leads to a poor user experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation.

SwiftShader remains a useful tool for doing headless testing on a site.  This use case is still supported by opting in, which you can do by running Microsoft Edge with the `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader` command-line argument.

See also:
* [Using Chromium with SwiftShader](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/gpu/swiftshader.md)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

Expires on August 31, 2025

`scope_extensions` is a new web application manifest member that enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.

Scope extensions allow web apps that rely on multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

```json
{
  "name": "Example app",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "origin": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The origins that are listed in the `scope_extensions` member must confirm that they are associated with the web app, by hosting a configuration file named `.well-known/web-app-origin-association`.  The file must list the web app's origin:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```
