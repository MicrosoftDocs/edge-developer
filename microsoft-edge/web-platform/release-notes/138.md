<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Enabled features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add prefetchCache and prerenderCache to Clear-Site-Data header

We propose adding two new values to the Clear-Site-Data header to help developers target clearing the prerender and prefetch cache: “prefetchCache” and “prerenderCache”.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Add support for video frame orientation metadata to WebCodecs

Introduces "rotation: int" and "flip: bool" values to various video related interfaces in WebCodecs so that developers can work with frame sources that have orientation (E.g., Android cameras, certain media).

The VideoFrame interface grows the ability to create VideoFrames with arbitrary rotation and flip as well as accessors for this information on the VideoFrame object.

The VideoDecoderConfig object gains rotation and flip fields that are emitted on decoded VideoFrame objects automatically.

The VideoEncoder class gains mechanisms for passing rotation and flip information from encode() to the VideoDecoderConfig emitted as part of EncodedVideoChunkMetadata. If encode() is called with frames with different orientations a non-fatal exception will be thrown. configure() may be used to reset the allowed orientation.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS &#39;stretch&#39; sizing keyword

A keyword for CSS sizing properties (e.g. 'width', 'height') that allows elements to grow to exactly fill their containing block's available space. It is similar to '100%', except the resulting size is applied to the element's margin box instead of the box indicated by 'box-sizing'. Using this keyword allows the element to keep its margins while still being as large as possible. An unprefixed version of '-webkit-fill-available'.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS Sign-Related Functions: abs(), sign()

The sign-related functions ​abs() and sign() ​compute various functions related to the sign of their argument.

The abs(A) function contains one calculation A, and returns the absolute value of A, as the same type as the input: if A’s numeric value is positive or 0⁺, just A again; otherwise -1 * A.

The sign(A) function contains one calculation A, and returns -1 if A’s numeric value is negative, +1 if A’s numeric value is positive, 0⁺ if A’s numeric value is 0⁺, and 0⁻ if A’s numeric value is 0⁻. The return type is a <number>, made consistent with the input calculation’s type.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS env variable for OS-level font scale

Exposes a user's preferred font scale to CSS. Currently, it is not practical for a page to detect if the user has changed their preferred font size via the Operating System's preferences. This CSS environment variable will reflect the scale chosen by the user.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS sibling-index() and sibling-count()

sibling-index() and sibling-count() can be used as integers in CSS property values to style elements based on their position among its siblings, or the total number of siblings respectively. These functions can be used directly as integer values, but more interestingly inside calc() expressions.

Example:

li { margin-left: calc(10px * sibling-index()); }



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Crash Reporting API: is_top_level &amp; visibility_state

This feature adds `is_top_level` and `visibility_state` string fields to the crash reporting API body that gets sent to the default reporting endpoint for crash reports. See https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/#crash-report.

For `is_top_level`: see https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/20 & https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/pull/23. The string value "true" or "false" is included depending on whether the Document sending the crash report belongs to a top-level traversable navigables.

For `visibility_state`: see https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/14#issuecomment-2452393164.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Disallow non-trustworthy plaintext HTTP prerendering

Disallow non-trustworthy plaintext HTTP prerendering.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Escape &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; in attributes on serialization

Escape "<" and ">" in values of attributes on serialization.

This mitigates the risk of mutation XSS attacks, which occur when value of an attribute is interpreted as a start tag token after being serialized and re-parsed.




<!-- ---------- -->
###### Integrity Policy for scripts

Subresource-Integrity (SRI) enables developers to make sure the assets they intend to load are indeed the assets they are loading. But there's no current way for developers to be sure that all of their scripts are validated using SRI.

The Integrity-Policy header gives developers the ability to assert that every resource of a given type needs to be integrity-checked. If a resource of that type is attempted to be loaded without integrity metadata, that attempt will fail and trigger a violation report.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Interpolation progress functional notation: CSS progress() function

The progress() functional notation returns a <number> value representing the position of one calculation (the progress value) between two other calculations (the progress start value and progress end value). progress() is a math function.

The syntax of progress() is defined as follows:

<progress()> = progress(<calc-sum>, <calc-sum>, <calc-sum>)
where the first, second, and third <calc-sum> values represent the progress value, progress start value, and progress end value, respectively.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Language Detector API

A JavaScript API for detecting the language of text, with confidence levels.

An important supplement to translation is language detection. This can be combined with translation, e.g. taking user input in an unknown language and translating it to a specific target language. Browsers today often already have langauge detection capabilities, and we want to offer them to web developers through a JavaScript API, supplementing the translation API. An enterprise policy (GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this API unavailable.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Nested view transitions

Allow view-transitions to generate a nested pseudo-element tree rather than a flat one.

This allows the view transition to appear more in line with its original elements and visual intent, as it enables clipping, nested 3D transforms, and proper application of effects like opacity, masking and filters.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### On-device Web Speech API

This feature adds on-device speech recognition support to the Web Speech API, allowing websites to ensure that neither audio nor transcribed speech are sent to a third-party service for processing.

Websites can query the availability of on-device speech recognition for specific languages, prompt users to install the necessary resources for on-device speech recognition, and choose between on-device or cloud-based speech recognition as needed.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Predictable reported storage quota

Report a predictable storage quota from StorageManager's estimate API for sites that do not have unlimited storage permissions.

It is possible to detect a user's browsing mode via the reported storage quota because the storage space made available is significantly smaller in incognito mode than in regular mode. This is a mitigation that prevents detection of a user's browsing mode via the storage API by reporting an artificial quota, equal to usage + min(10 GiB, disk rounded up to the nearest 1 GiB), in all browsing modes for sites with limited storage permissions. Sites with unlimited storage permissions will be unaffected. Enforced quota will also be unaffected.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Pushsubscriptionchange event upon resubscription

Fire the pushsubscriptionchange event in service workers when an origin for which a push subscription existed in the past, but which was revoked because of a permission change (from granted to deny/default), is re-granted notification permission.

The event will be fired with an empty oldSubscription and newSubscription.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Speculation rules: target_hint field

This extends speculation rules syntax to allow developers to specify the target_hint field.

This field provides a hint to indicate a target navigable where a prerendered page will eventually be activated. For example, when _blank is specified as a hint, a prerendered page can be activated for a navigable opened by window.open(). The field has no effect on prefetching.

The specification allows this field to accept any strings that are valid as navigable target name or keyword as the value, but this launch supports only one of "_self" or "_blank" strings. If the hint is not specified, it's treated like "_self" is specified.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Strict Same Origin Policy for Storage Access API

Adjusts the Storage Access API semantics to strictly follow the Same Origin Policy, w.r.t. security. I.e., using document.requestStorageAccess() in a frame only attaches cookies to requests to the iframe's origin (not site) by default.

Note: the CookiesAllowedForUrls policy and/or Storage Access Headers may still be used to unblock cross-site cookies.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Summarizer API

A JavaScript API for producing summaries of input text, backed by an AI language model. Browsers and operating systems are increasingly expected to gain access to a language model. By exposing this built-in model, we avoid every website needing to download their own multi-gigabyte language model, or send input text to third-party APIs. The summarizer API in particular exposes a high-level API for interfacing with a language model in order to summarize inputs for a variety of use cases [1], in a way that does not depend on the specific language model in question.

An enterprise policy (GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this API unavailable.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Translator API

A JavaScript API to provide language translation capabilities to web pages. Browsers are increasingly offering language translation to their users. Such translation capabilities can also be useful to web developers. This is especially the case when browser's built-in translation abilities cannot help. An enterprise policy (GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this API unavailable.



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Viewport Segments Enumeration API

The Viewport Segments API allows developers to adapt their website/webapp layout to target foldable devices. The viewport segments defines the position and dimensions of a logically separate region of the viewport. Viewport segments are created when the viewport is split by one or more hardware features (such as a fold or a hinge between separate displays) that act as a divider; segments are the regions of the viewport that can be treated as logically distinct by the author.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

Adds a "scope_extensions" web app manifest field that enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.  

Example usage:
{
  "name": "Example",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {"type" : "origin", "origin" : "https://example.com"}
  ]
}

This allows sites that control multiple subdomains and top level domains to be presented as a single web app. 

Requires listed origins to confirm association with the web app using a .well-known/web-app-origin-association configuration file.

{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web serial over Bluetooth on Android

This feature allows web pages and web apps to connect to serial ports over Bluetooth on Android devices.

Chrome on Android now supports Web Serial API over Bluetooth RFCOMM. Existing enterprise policies (DefaultSerialGuardSetting, SerialAllowAllPortsForUrls, SerialAllowUsbDevicesForUrls, SerialAskForUrls and SerialBlockedForUrls) on other platforms are enabled in future_on states for Android. All policies except SerialAllowUsbDevicesForUrls will be enabled after the feature is enabled. SerialAllowUsbDevicesForUrls will be enabled in a future launch after Android provides system level support of wired serial ports.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebGPU &#39;core-features-and-limits&#39;

The 'core-features-and-limits' feature signifies a WebGPU adapter and device support the core features and limits of the spec.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Deprecated and removed features

**TODO: CHECK THE FEATURES LISTED BELOW AND ADD THEM TO THE SITE-COMPAT-IMPACTING-CHANGES ARTICLE.**



<!-- ---------- -->
###### Deprecate asynchronous range removal for Media Source Extensions

The Media Source standard long ago changed to disallow ambiguously defined behavior involving asynchronous range removals:
* SourceBuffer.abort() no longer aborts SourceBuffer.remove() operations
* Setting MediaSource.duration can no longer truncate currently buffered media

Exceptions will be thrown in both of these cases now. 

Safari and Firefox have long shipped this behavior, Chromium is the last browser remaining with the old behavior. Use counters show ~0.001%-0.005% of page loads hit the deprecated behavior. Primarily small Russian sites. If a site hits this issue, playback may now break.

Usage of abort() cancelling removals is increasing, so it's prudent to resolve this deprecation before more incompatible usage appears.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Remove SwiftShader fallback

Allowing automatic fallback to WebGL backed by the software renderer SwiftShader is deprecated and WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. This was done for two primary reasons:

1. SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.
2. Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.

SwiftShader is a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content.

To opt-in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the --enable-unsafe-swiftshader command-line switch.

During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the javascript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing --enable-unsafe-swiftshader will remove this warning message.

Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. Please test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user.
