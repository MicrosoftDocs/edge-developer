<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### CSS features


<!-- ---------- -->
###### CSS `::search-text` pseudo-element

The CSS `::search-text` pseudo-element lets you style the results of the browser's find-in-page search.

This allows you to change the foreground and background colors of search results, which can be useful if the browser default colors have insufficient contrast with the page colors.

See also:
* [::search-text](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-search-text) in _CSS Pseudo-Elements Module Level 4_.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `document.activeViewTransition` property

The `document.activeViewTransition` property provides access to the currently running view transition, whether this transition is on a single web page, or between two web pages.

The View Transition API allows you to create visual transitions between different states of a single page, or between multiple pages.

For transitions within single pages, the `document.startViewTransition()` method returns a transition object. The `document.activeViewTransition` property now provides access to this transition object, which means you no longer need to store the `document.startViewTransition()` return value.

For transitions between multiple pages the `document.activeViewTransition` property now gives you access to the currently running transition object, for the duration of the transition. This is in addition to the `pageswap` and `pagereveal` events.

See also:
* [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) at MDN.
* [Document: startViewTransition() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) at MDN.
* [Window: pageswap event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pageswap_event) at MDN.
* [Window: pagereveal event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pagereveal_event) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support `width` and `height` presentational attributes on nested `<svg>` elements

You can now use the `width` and `height` presentational attributes on nested `<svg>` elements, through both SVG markup and CSS.  This approach provides greater flexibility, allowing you to style SVG elements more efficiently within complex designs.

With this feature, the following two HTML code snippets now produce the same output:

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
  <svg style="width:50px;height:50px;">
    <circle cx="50px" cy="50px" r="40px" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</svg>
```

```html
<svg width="100px" height="100px">
  <svg width="50px" height="50px">
    <circle cx="50px" cy="50px" r="40px" fill="green" />
  </svg>
</svg>
```

In the second line:
* The first example uses a `style` attribute that contains width and height values.
* The second example uses separate `width` and `height` attributes.

See also:
* [`<svg>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/svg) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- 
todo: this is planned to ship with 142 after all. Keeping here until we need it for the 142 release notes.
###### Range syntax for style container queries and `if()` functions

The CSS `@container style()` queries and `if()` functions now support the range syntax.

The range syntax makes it possible to compare custom properties and values by using the `<` and `>` operators.

For a comparison to be valid, both sides of the comparison must resolve to the same data type. This is limited to the following numeric types: `<length>`, `<number>`, `<percentage>`, `<angle>`, `<time>`, `<frequency>`, and `<resolution>`.

Example comparing a custom property with a literal length:

```css
@container style(--inner-padding > 1em) {
  .card { border: 2px solid; }
}
```

Example comparing two literal values:

```css
@container style(1em < 20px) {
  ...
}
```

Example comparing a value from the `attr()` substitution function with a literal value:

```css
.item-grid {
  background-color: if(style(attr(data-columns, type<number>) > 2): lightblue; else: white);
}
```

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Web APIs


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `ariaNotify()` API

The `ariaNotify()` API enables your app to directly tell a screen reader what to say when there's a non-user-initiated change in the content of a webpage.  In the simplest scenario, you call `ariaNotify("foo")` on the document or on an element.

See also:
* [Creating a more accessible web with Aria Notify](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/05/05/creating-a-more-accessible-web-with-aria-notify/).


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `dataTransfer` property for `insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop`, and `insertReplacementText` input events

For better interoperability with other browsers, the input event objects of type `insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop`, and `insertReplacementText` now have a `dataTransfer` property.

The `dataTransfer` property provides access to the clipboard or drag-drop data when the user edits text within a `contenteditable` element. The same data is also available with `beforeinput` events.

This feature only applies to `contenteditable` elements.

See also:
* [DataTransfer](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) at MDN.
* [InputEvent: inputType property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/InputEvent/inputType) at MDN.
* [HTML contenteditable global attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### IndexedDB `getAllRecords()` method and `direction` option for `getAll()` and `getAllKeys()`

IndexedDB `IDBObjectStore` and `IDBIndex` objects now support the `getAllRecords()` method, which returns index keys, primary keys, and values for each record, in addition to supporting read operations in both directions.

The `getAllRecords()` method can make certain IndexedDB read operations significantly faster when compared to existing alternatives such as using IndexedDB cursors.

This feature also introduces the `direction` option to the existing `getAll()` and `getAllKeys()` methods, for consistency.

See also:
* [Even faster IndexedDB reads with getAllRecords](https://patrickbrosset.com/articles/2024-11-19-even-faster-indexeddb-reads-with-getallrecords/) <!-- We don't have MDN docs for getAllRecords yet. When we do, replace this link with MDN docs. -->
* [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Navigation API `precommitHandler`

The `navigateEvent.intercept()` method now supports a `precommitHandler` option that's similar to `handler` option.

The `precommitHandler` option is used to defer the commit of a navigation event, and therefore the URL update, until after the handler's promise has resolved. The `precommitHandler` option also allows the handler to change the navigation URL, information, status, and history push and replace behavior.

Without a `precommitHandler`, the navigation API immediately commits navigations, which is sometimes an issue for JavaScript routing libraries that use asynchronous same-document navigations.

See also:
* [Navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API) at MDN.
* [NavigateEvent: intercept() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NavigateEvent/intercept) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `windowAudio` option for `getDisplayMedia()`

The `getDisplayMedia()` method now supports the `windowAudio` option.

The `windowAudio` option allows you to the give the user the ability to share audio when a window is selected for screen sharing. `windowAudio` can be set to `exclude`, `system`, or `window`.

See also:
* [MediaDevices: getDisplayMedia() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Extended `echoCancellation` option for `getUserMedia()`

The `echoCancellation` option for `getUserMedia()` is now extended from a `true` and `false` to also support `all` and `remote-only`.

This allows you to modify the echo cancellation behavior that's applied to audio tracks received from microphones, and control how much of the user system playout is removed from the microphone signal.

In some scenarios the only acceptable echo cancellation option is removing all user system playou​t from the microphone, for example to ensure that no privacy-sensitive playout, such as from screen readers or system notifications is captured.

In other scenarios you might prefer to remove the echo from `RTCPeerConnections`, to enable 2-way RTC communication, while still capturing the rest of the local playout.

See also:
* [MediaDevices: getUserMedia() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) at MDN.
* [MediaTrackConstraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints) at MDN.
* [MediaTrackConstraints: echoCancellation property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints/echoCancellation) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### `restrictOwnAudio` media track constraint


The new `restrictOwnAudio` media track constraint can help create cleaner screen recordings, such as when the capturing webpage itself is playing audio and you don't want that audio to be included in the capture, to avoid undesirable echo.

By default, when using `getDisplayMedia()` and when the system audio is captured, all audio that's played by the system is captured.  If the `restrictOwnAudio` constraint is set, the captured system audio is filtered to exclude audio originating from the document that called `getDisplayMedia()`.

See also:
* [MediaDevices: getDisplayMedia() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia) at MDN.
* [MediaTrackConstraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Support for alternative fields in FedCM account selection

Phone numbers and usernames are now supported, in addition to or instead of a user's full name and email address, as identifiers for disambiguating accounts in the FedCM account selector.

These new fields are also now available for websites to affect the disclosure text.

This change makes it easier for identity providers that don't use email addresses and full names for identifying users to adopt FedCM.

See also:
* [Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Eagerness improvements in speculation rules

The `eager` value of a speculation rule's `eagerness` option now triggers prefetches and prerenders when the user hovers on a link for a short time.

Previously, the `eager` value would start prefetching and prerendering as soon as possible, similar to the `immediate` value. The new behavior is more useful as the `eager` value is now more eager than the `moderate` value and less eager than `immediate` value.

More detail on this and other upcoming improvements to speculation rules eagerness are available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPbtUPfZIDElzBZNx8IQMzRFvy8oauLG_i1XIr6jgTs/edit?usp=sharing.

* [eagerness](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/speculationrules#eagerness) in _&lt;script type="speculationrules"&gt;_, at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### WebRTC Encoded Transform

The WebRTC Encoded Transform API allows you to process the data being sent via an `RTCPeerConnection`.

See also:
* [WebRTC Encoded Transform](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/)
* [Using WebRTC Encoded Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_Encoded_Transforms) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Strict Same-origin policy for Storage Access API

The Storage Access API now follows the Same-origin policy.

By default, using `document.requestStorageAccess()` in a frame only attaches cookies to the requests that are made to the iframe's origin.  The `CookiesAllowedForUrls` policy and storage access headers can still be used to unblock cross-site cookies.

See also:
* [Storage Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API) at MDN.


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Signature-based subresource integrity

Checking for subresource integrity on a webpage can now be done by using Ed25519 signatures, in addition to using the static digests of resource content.

This gives you a mechanism to verify the provenance of resources your page depends upon, creating a technical foundation for trust in a site's dependencies. Your web server can sign responses with a Ed25519 key pair, and you then can require the browser to verify the signature using a specific public key.

See also:
* [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) at MDN.
* [Signature-based Integrity](https://wicg.github.io/signature-based-sri/)

## Origin trials

The following are new experimental APIs which you can try on your own live website for a limited time.

To learn more about origin trials, see [Use origin trials in Microsoft Edge](../../origin-trials/index.md).

To see the full list of available origin trials, see [Microsoft Edge Origin Trials](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Microsoft Edge-only origin trials


<!-- ---------- -->
###### Web app scope extensions

Expires on August 31, 2025

`scope_extensions` is a new web app manifest member that enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.

Scope extensions allow web apps that rely on multiple subdomains and top-level domains to be presented as a single web app.

```json
{
  "name": "Example app",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "scope_extensions": [
    {
      "type": "type",
      "origin": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

The origins that are listed in the `scope_extensions` member must confirm that they are associated with the web app, by hosting a configuration file named `.well-known/web-app-origin-association`.  The file must list the web app's origin:

```json
{
  "https://sample-app.com/": {
    "scope": "/"
  }
}
```
