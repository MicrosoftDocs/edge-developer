# Designing accessible websites

<!-- summary sentence -->

Create a webpage design that's usable by all people, no matter their mouse or keyboard preference, age, education, geographic location, language, or disability.

<!-- /summary sentence -->

People using technology and browsing the web have a wide range of abilities and preferences.  As you design your website, keep in mind the following key accessibility scenarios.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Screen readers

Users who are blind or who have low vision rely on screen readers to interpret and interact with the UI of your app.  Interpreting involves reading the UI element names, roles, and values.  Interacting with the UI involves moving the focus from one element to another and invoking functionality such as clicking a UI element.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Keyboard accessibility

Many accessibility users rely on the keyboard to navigate and operate the UI by:

*  Moving focus among elements by pressing the **Tab** key or **Shift+Tab** keys.

*  Navigating in container elements such as lists, grids, and tree views by using the arrow keys.

*  Invoking actions by pressing the **Enter** key or **Spacebar**.

*  Using shortcut keys to efficiently access other app functionality.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Accessible visual experience

Users who have low vision need a sufficient text contrast ratio for text content, and a good visual experience with high contrast themes overall.  Users who are color blind need information to be conveyed in ways other than through color.

Many common accessibility issues on the web can be solved through good coding practice.  The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20) documentation provides techniques and best practices to help you design more accessible dynamic web applications.  For more information, go to [Resources about building accessible websites](build/index.md).
