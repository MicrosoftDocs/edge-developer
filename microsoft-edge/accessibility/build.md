# Building Accessible Websites
The web is filled with dynamic and complex websites, applications, and user interfaces built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  However, when designed and built without accessibility in mind, these complex websites are difficult to use by people who rely on [assistive technologies](https://webaim.org/articles/motor/assistive) to browse the web. Building websites that are accessible to people with disabilities requires semantic information about the user interface. This allows for assistive technologies, like screen readers, to convey the necessary information to help people with a range of abilities use the website.

Visit [HTML5Accessibility](https://html5accessibility.com) for information on which new HTML5 features are accessibly supported by Microsoft Edge.

## How Accessibility Works

Assistive technologies add capabilities that computers don't usually have. For example, a visually impaired user might use their keyboard in combination with assistive technology such as a screen reader, rather than directly using the browser with the mouse and screen. For applications on Microsoft platforms and on the web, the assistive technology interacts with Microsoft [UI Automation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb892135.aspx), an application-specific object model such as the Document Object Model (DOM) in Microsoft Edge, or a combination of these.

For web developers, certain HTML elements are mapped to UI Automation objects, so in selecting those HTML elements, the developer can use the accessibility properties and events built in to those elements. While developing your website, you usually only need to be concerned with ensuring that the API is correctly written to (or that the appropriate element is specified), in order for the application to be accessible. Check out [ARIA and UI Automation in Microsoft Edge](./build/ARIA-and-UI-Automation.md) for more information.  For information on accessible Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, see the [Accessibility](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/accessibility/accessibility) topic in the Windows Dev Center.

Many common accessibility issues with dynamic content can be addressed by good coding practice, and the [WCAG 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=24629) documentation includes many techniques and best practices to help you create more accessible dynamic web applications. Even when coded properly, however, dynamic content is not necessarily accessible. [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](#aria) helps overcome this issue.  

For more information on web accessibility, check out the [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php) by the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) (WAI).

## ARIA
The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) (ARIA) specification by the W3C's [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) defines as a syntax for making dynamic web content and custom user interfaces accessible to all people. ARIA extends HTML by using additional attributes (roles, properties, and states) that are designed to convey custom semantics. These attributes are used by browsers to pass along the controls' state and role to the accessibility API.

### Roles, Properties, and States
ARIA roles are set on elements using the [`role`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc304102(v=vs.85).aspx) attribute to give assistive technologies and accessibility APIs information about the element. For example, the below `<li>` element is assigned `role="menuitem"` to signify it's an item in a menu.

``` html
<li role="menuitem">Home</li>
```

ARIA states and properties are aria-prefixed attributes that provide specific information about an object to help form the definition of the nature of roles. Properties are attributes that are essential to the nature of an object, like [`aria-readonly`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc304089(v=vs.85).aspx) and [`aria-haspopup`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc304081(v=vs.85).aspx). Changing a property affects the meaning of the object. In the example below, the property `aria-haspopup="true"` is set on a `<li>` menu item to signify it has a popup.

``` html
<li role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">Open</li>
```

States do not change the nature of the object, but represent information associated with the object or user interaction with the object, like [`aria-hidden`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc304083(v=vs.85).aspx) or [`aria-checked`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc304075(v=vs.85).aspx). For example, the state `aria-checked="false"` in the example below represents that the checkbox is not checked.

``` html
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">Accept</div>
```

Go to [The Roles Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles) by the W3C to see a full list of roles, properties, and states.
