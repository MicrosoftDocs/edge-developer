# Resources about building accessible websites

The web is filled with dynamic and complex websites, applications, and user interfaces built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  However, when designed and built without accessibility in mind, these complex websites are difficult to use by people who rely on [assistive technologies](https://webaim.org/articles/motor/assistive) to browse the web.

Building websites that are accessible to people with disabilities requires semantic information about the user interface.  Accessible websites allow assistive technologies, like screen readers, to convey the necessary information to help people with a range of abilities use the website.

Visit [HTML5Accessibility](https://html5accessibility.com) for information on which new HTML5 features are accessibly supported by Microsoft Edge.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## How accessibility works

Assistive technologies add capabilities that computers don't usually have.  For example, a user who has low vision might use their keyboard in combination with assistive technology such as a screen reader, rather than directly using the browser with the mouse and screen.  

For applications on Microsoft platforms and on the web, the assistive technology interacts with any combination of:
*  Microsoft [UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/uiauto-specandcommunitypromise).
*  An application-specific object model such as the Document Object Model (DOM) in Microsoft Edge.

For web developers, certain HTML elements are mapped to UI Automation objects, so in selecting those HTML elements, the developer can use the accessibility properties and events built in to those elements.  While developing your website, you usually only need to make sure that the API is correctly written to, or that the appropriate element is specified, for the application to be accessible.

Check out [ARIA and UI automation in Microsoft Edge](./aria-and-ui-automation.md) for more information.  Accessible Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps are explained at [Accessibility](/windows/uwp/design/accessibility/accessibility) in Windows Dev Center.

Many common accessibility issues with dynamic content can be addressed by good coding practice.  The [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20) documentation includes many techniques and best practices to help you create more accessible dynamic web applications.  Even when coded properly, however, dynamic content is not necessarily accessible.  [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](#aria) helps overcome this issue.

For more information on web accessibility, check out the [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php) by the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## ARIA

The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria) specification by the W3C's [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI) defines as a syntax for making dynamic web content and custom user interfaces accessible to all people.  ARIA extends HTML by using additional attributes (roles, properties, and states) that are designed to convey custom semantics.  These attributes are used by browsers to pass along the controls' state and role to the accessibility API.

### Roles, properties, and states

ARIA roles are set on elements using the [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference) attribute to give assistive technologies and accessibility APIs information about the element.  For example, the below `<li>` element is assigned `role="menuitem"` to signify that it's an item in a menu.

```html
<li role="menuitem">Home</li>
```

ARIA states and properties are aria-prefixed attributes that provide specific information about an object to help form the definition of the nature of roles.  Properties are attributes that are essential to the nature of an object, like [aria-readonly](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) and [aria-haspopup](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA).  Changing a property affects the meaning of the object.

In the example below, the property `aria-haspopup="true"` is set on a `<li>` menu item to signify that it has a popup:

```html
<li role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">Open</li>
```

States don't change the nature of the object, but represent information that's associated with the object, or user interaction with the object, like [aria-hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) or [aria-checked](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA).  For example, the state `aria-checked="false"` in the example below represents that the checkbox is cleared, rather than selected:

```html
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">Accept</div>
```

To see a full list of roles, properties, and states, go to [The Roles Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1#roles) at W3C.

## Assistive technology compatibility testing

Verifying that the website you are building works with real assistive technologies is the best way to ensure that you provide a good experience for users with disabilities.  Since many assistive technologies make use of the keyboard, testing the keyboard accessibility of your website is a good place to start.

[Keyboard compatibility testing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/keyboard) validates that users have access to all interactive controls without requiring a mouse.  Microsoft [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview) is a browser extension for Microsoft Edge and Chrome that guides you and reveals several common issues.

Once you are confident that your website works well with a keyboard, try it with other assistive technologies, such as screen readers.  This testing can uncover issues in the following:

*   Your HTML, ARIA, and CSS.
*   The level of support of an assistive technology for a feature or technique.

Different browsers might map elements to the platform accessibility APIs differently than Microsoft Edge maps them.  While building your interface, it's important to consider each difference.

WebAIM conducts surveys with [screen reader](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8) and [low vision](https://webaim.org/projects/lowvisionsurvey2) users that help you decide which assistive technologies and browsers to test.

### Learning how to test

Assistive technologies are sophisticated tools.  Don't assume that you're able to immediately start testing with an assistive technology without first learning about how it works.  Learning to test with a screen reader has an especially steep learning curve.  A novice user of screen readers might think that a screen reader has a bug, while the issue might actually be an error in using the screen reader.

[Testing with Screen Readers](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing) at WebAIM provides more information about learning to test with assistive technologies.

### Testing locally

Most devices include assistive technology that is built-in to the OS.  Microsoft Windows includes the [Windows Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/help/22798) screen reader and [Windows Magnifier](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198).  3rd party assistive technologies like [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda), [FreedomscientificSoftwareJaws](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws), and [ZoomText](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/zoomtext) are available to download.  Apple macOS includes the [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision) screen reader.  And iOS, Android, and Linux all support a variety of assistive technologies.

### Testing in virtual machines and emulators

Under macOS, if you want to test with an assistive technology only available for Windows, like Windows Narrator or NVDA, create a Windows virtual machine.  Virtual machines with Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) and IE are available for VirtualBox and VMWare on the [Virtual Machines download page](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/tools/vms).

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) includes an emulator that for you to test assistive technologies in the [Android Accessibility Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback).  Follow the instructions to [set up a virtual device](https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds.html) and [start the emulator](https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html), then install [Android Accessibility Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback) from the GooglePlay store.

> [!NOTE]
> The iOS Simulator does not currently include VoiceOver.

### Cloud-based testing tools

If an assistive technology is not available on your OS or you not possible to install one on a virtual machine or emulator, cloud-based assistive technology testing tools are the next best thing.

*  [Assistiv Labs](https://assistivlabs.com) (a commercial product) enables you to manually test with assistive technologies through any modern web browser.  Select an assistive technology and browser and it connects you with a virtual machine, emulator, or real device that you can interact with.
