# ARIA and UI automation in Microsoft Edge

The W3C defines Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) as a syntax for making dynamic web content and custom UI accessible.  Microsoft Edge recognizes the ARIA role, state, and property information and exposes it to assistive technologies, which in turn can use the [Microsoft UI Automation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/winuiautomation/) APIs to retrieve the information.

Visit [HTML5Accessibility](https://html5accessibility.com) for information on which new HTML5 features are accessibly supported by Microsoft Edge.

The Microsoft Edge rendering engine builds an accessible projection of web pages, conforming to the following W3C specifications.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Mapping HTML elements to ARIA and UI Automation objects

The [HTML Accessibility API Mappings](https://w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/) specification defines how HTML elements and attributes map to ARIA and UI Automation objects.
* [Working draft](https://w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/) - stable version of the specification.
* [Editor's draft](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/) - work in progress.  Note that while this spec has the latest changes, the changes may not be available in Microsoft Edge yet.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Building the accessibility tree and mapping ARIA elements to UI Automation objects

The [Core Accessibility API Mappings](https://w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/) specification defines general principles for building the accessibility tree and mapping ARIA elements and attributes to UI Automation objects.
* [Working draft](https://w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/) - stable version of the specification.
* [Editor's draft](https://w3c.github.io/core-aam/) - work in progress.  Note that while this spec has the latest changes, the changes may not be available in Microsoft Edge yet.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Computing descriptions of accessible objects given the HTML and ARIA elements

The [Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings](https://w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/) specification defines how to compute the name and description of accessible objects, given the HTML and given the ARIA elements and attribute values that are available for the accessible elements.
* [Working draft](https://w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/) - stable version of the specification.
* [Editor's draft](https://w3c.github.io/accname/) - work in progress.  Note that while this spec has the latest changes, the changes may not be available in Microsoft Edge yet.
