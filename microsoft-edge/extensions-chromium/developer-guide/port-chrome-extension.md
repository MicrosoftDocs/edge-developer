# Port your extension  

Microsoft Edge allows you to port your Chrome extension with minimal changes.  The Extension APIs and manifest keys supported by Chrome are code-compatible with Microsoft Edge.  For a list of APIs supported by Microsoft Edge, navigate to [API support][ExtensionApiSupport].  

To port your Chrome extension, complete the following steps.  

1.  Review the Chrome extension APIs used in your extensions with the Microsoft Edge extensions [supported APIs][ExtensionApiSupport] list.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your extension uses APIs that are not supported by Microsoft Edge, it may not port directly.  
    
1. Change the "update_URL" field in the manifest file to the value `https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx`. This will point to the crx of your extension in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store and allow the Edge client to check for  extension updates.
1. If the name `Chrome` is being used in either the name or the description of the extension, rebrand the extension for `Microsoft Edge`.  This step is required to pass the certification process.  
1.  Test your extension to check if it works in Microsoft Edge by [sideloading your extension][ExtensionsGettingStartedExtensionSideloading].  
1.  If you face any issues, you may debug your extensions in Microsoft Edge by using the DevTools, or [contact us][mailtoExtensionMicrosoft].  
1.  Follow the [publishing guidelines][ExtensionsPublishPublishExtension] to publish your extension on Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the extension exchanges messages with a native app using `chrome.runtime.connectNative` API, ensure that you set `allowed_origins` to `extension://[Microsoft-Catalog-extensionID]` in your native messaging host manifest file.  This enables the app to identify the extension.  
    
## Next steps  

Once your extension package is ready to be published to Microsoft Edge add-ons store, [create a developer account][ExtensionsPublishCreateDevAccount] and [publish your extension][ExtensionsPublishPublishExtension].
