Manage your account settings and profile details for your Microsoft Edge Developer account at [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/public/login?ref=dd).

## Account settings

To display your account settings, select the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/public/login?ref=dd) > **Developer settings**.  In **Developer settings**, review and update the following information.

*   Edit your account information.

In the **Account details** section, review the status and type of your account.  Your Seller ID and other publisher ID info are also displayed in the **Account details** section.  The values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account and are read-only.

## Contact Details

The **Contact info** section displays the details you provided when you created your account.  The Microsoft Edge extension team uses the contact details information to contact you about your account.

If your contact information changes edit the **Contact info** section.  Select **Update**, make your changes, and then select **Save**.  You can also select **Contact info** in the left navigation menu to open the **Contact info** section.

If you need to change any of your contact details, the Microsoft Edge extension team might verify your account again, especially if you have a company account.

The verification process ranges from a few days to a couple of weeks, and your company might receive a phone call from our verification partner.
