# Manage Account Settings  

Manage the setting for you Microsoft Edge Developer account.  You view and update your account settings and Profile details in the Account setting section of the [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  

## Account settings  

To view your account settings, click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and then select **Developer settings**.  The **Developer settings** displays details about your account, links to other pages where you view information, and you may perform various account-related tasks.  

In the **Account details** section, you see the status and type of your account.  You also see your Seller ID and other publisher ID info here.  These values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account and are read-only.  

## Contact Details  

The **Contact info** section displays the details you provided when setting up your account.  We use this detail to contact you about your account.  The publisher display name that we show to your users in the Microsoft Edge Addons catalog \(Edge Addons\) also appears here.  
  
You should edit this section if any of your contact details has changed. To do so, click **Update** \(or select **Contact info** in the left navigation menu\), make your changes, and then click **Save**.  

Changing any of your contact details may require us to verify your account again, especially if you have a company account.  Your verification status returns to `Pending` while this is in process.  The duration of the verification process ranges from a few days to a couple of weeks, and your company may receive a phone call from our verification partner.  

## Other settings  

Review the following settings in the Account settings section.  

| Account Settings | Description |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Verification status | When your account is undergoing the verification process \(example, when you first sign up or after you significantly update your contact info\), you review your verification status here. |  
| Programs | View details about the programs in which you are participating and learn about other programs that may be of interest.  
| Agreements | View the agreements that your account has accepted. |
