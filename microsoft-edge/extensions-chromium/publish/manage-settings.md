# Manage Account Settings  

Manage your account settings and profile details for your Microsoft Edge Developer account in [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  

## Account settings  

To display your account settings, choose the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] > **Developer settings**.  In the **Developer settings**, review and update the following information.  

*   Review information about your account.  
*   Links to other pages to review information.  
*   Edit your account information.  
    
In the **Account details** section, review the status and type of your account.  Your Seller ID and other publisher ID info are also displayed in the **Account details** section.  The values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account and are read-only.  

## Contact Details  

The **Contact info** section displays the details you provided when you created your account.  The Microsoft Edge extension team uses the contact details information to contact you about your account.  The publisher display name displayed in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store is also displayed is the **Contact info** section.  
  
To change your contact information, navigate to **Contact info** section and edit the field.  Choose **Update**, make your changes, and then choose **Save**.  You may also choose **Contact info** in the left navigation menu to open the **Contact info** section.  

If you need to change any of your contact details such as **Publisher display name (Company name)**, the Microsoft Edge extension team may verify your account again, especially if you have a company account.  Your verification status returns to `Pending` while the review is in process.  The verification process ranges from a few days to a couple of weeks, and your company may receive a phone call from our verification partner.
To reflect the changes on the Edge add-ons though, you will need to submit an update, either the package update or metadata update, to your extension on Partner Center.

> [!NOTE]
> Extension URL does not change with the change in Publisher name.

## Other settings  

Review the following settings in the Account settings section.  

| Account Settings | Description |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Verification status | Review your verification status when your account is going through the verification process.  For example, your account is verified when you first create an account, or after you update your contact information.  |

| Agreements | Review the agreements that your account accepted.  |
