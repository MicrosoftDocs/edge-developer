# Curation and review process for the Edge Add-ons store

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons store curates the Edge store experience so that users can find all the items to customize their browser in one place, such as themes, extensions, and apps.

Before installing an item from the Edge Add-ons store, users can learn more about the functionality, data permissions, and publisher by viewing the item's description and listing.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Organizing Edge Add-ons store items

The store organizes the items to help users discover the ones that are relevant to their interests.

Users can also discover the items they are interested in on the Edge Add-ons store in several ways, including:
* The home page.
* The Search bar.
* Curated collections of store items.
* Categories of store items.

The following factors are used to organize items:
* **Quality:** Items featured on the Edge Add-ons store are selected based on their eligibility criteria.
* **Relevancy:** Ranking takes into consideration factors such as the item name, description relevancy, popularity, and user experience.

The Search ranking of the item is based on these characteristics.
