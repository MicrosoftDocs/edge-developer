# Extension hosting

Most extensions are published at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/), to protect users from malicious extensions.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Publish options for extensions

All extensions are distributed to users as a special archive (`.zip`) file with a `.crx` suffix.  Extensions that are published at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/) are uploaded as `.zip` files.  The publishing process automatically converts the `.zip` file into a `.crx` file.

The following two scenarios don't require you to publish your extension at Microsoft Edge Add-ons:
*  Extensions that are distributed using Enterprise policy.
*  Using unpacked extension directories on a local machine when Microsoft Edge is in developer mode.

In both cases, Microsoft Edge periodically checks extension hosts for new versions of installed extensions and automatically updates them without user intervention.
