# Register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer  

To submit your extension to the Microsoft Edge add-ons website, you must be registered as a developer with the Microsoft Edge program on [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  There is no registration fee involved in submitting extensions to the Microsoft Edge program.  

## Before you begin  

If you do not have an account or if you have an existing commercial account with Partner Center, you must create a new [Microsoft account (MSA)][WindowsCommunityEverythingAboutMicrosoftAccounts] to register with the Microsoft Edge program.  To create a Microsoft account \(Outlook/live/Hotmail\), visit [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount] and select **Create a Microsoft account**.  If you are registered on the Partner center with a developer account, use the corresponding Microsoft account \(MSA\) to sign-in, and then enroll in the Microsoft Edge program.  

> [!NOTE]
> Today the Microsoft Edge extensions team does not support signing up with a work or school account.  In the future, the Microsoft Edge extensions team plans to support linking AAD tenants to MSA accounts for extension management.  

## Enroll in the Microsoft Edge program on Partner Center  

1.  Go to the [developer page][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and select **GO TO DASHBOARD**.  
1.  If you are not already signed in with a **Microsoft account**, sign-in now, or create a new Microsoft account.  You use the same Microsoft account that you use to sign into your developer account.  After you sign-in, this registration form is displayed.  
    
    To enroll in the Microsoft Edge program, sign in-to your account, and complete the form.

          *   `Individual account`  
              An individual account is appropriate for a developer not associated with a company.  The account verification process is shorter, and involves verifying that the publisher display name is available.

              A company account is associated with an organization or business.  The account verification process is longer, and involves confirmation that you are authorized to create the account for your company.  The duration of the process may range from a few days to a few weeks.  Your company may receive phone calls from Microsoft verification partners.
