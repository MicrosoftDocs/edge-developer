# Open A New Developer Account  

Open a new Microsoft Edge Developer account.  Before you submit the Extension, you must set up a Microsoft Edge developer account in [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter]  

> [!NOTE]
> Do you have a Microsoft Account?  To create a developer account for Microsoft Edge, you must have a Microsoft account email \(You are not able to sign up with a work or school email address\).  If you do not have a Microsoft account, go to [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount], select **Sign in**, and then choose **Create one!**.  

1.  Go to the [developer page][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and select **GO TO DASHBOARD**.  
1.  If you are not already signed in with a **Microsoft account**, sign in now, or create a new Microsoft account.  You use the same Microsoft account that you use to sign into your developer account.  After you sign in, this registration form is displayed:  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are already registered as a Windows app developer with Microsoft, you are automatically registered with a Microsoft Edge developer account.  
    
1.  Fill out the following fields.  
    
    | Field | Description | Possible values |  
    |:--- |:--- |:--- |  
    | Country/region | Where you live, or where your business is located.  You are not able to change this later. |  |  
    | Developer account type | The account type.  You are not able to change this later, so be sure to choose the right type of account.  See [Account Types](#account-types). | `Individual` or `Company` |  
    | Publisher display name | The name to use \(50 characters or fewer\).  Select this carefully, users see this name when browsing your Extensions.  For company accounts, be sure to use the registered business name of your organization. |  |  
    | Contact details | For company accounts, be sure to use the registered email address of your organization. |  |  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > For **Publisher display name**, you may use a name only if it is available and that you have the rights to use.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > For **Contact details**, Microsoft uses these details to contact you about account-related matters.  Example, you receive an email confirmation after you complete your registration.  After that, we send messages if you have issues with your account.  If you are registering as a company, you must also enter the **name**, **email address**, and **phone number** of the person who approves your company account.  
    
    Review your account details and confirm that everything is correct.  Then, read and accept the terms and conditions of the [Microsoft Edge Developer Agreement][MicrosoftAppDeveloperAgreement].  
    
1.  Click **Finish** to confirm your registration.  

## Account Types  

The Microsoft Edge program in [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] offers both individual and company accounts.  Either type of account gives you access to publish Extensions to the Microsoft Edge Addons catalog \(Microsoft Edge Addons\) and to participate in any Microsoft program.  

Company accounts are intended for organizations and businesses.  For company accounts, we require greater verification to confirm that you have authorization to set up the account for your company.  Individual accounts are usually appropriate for a single developer working on their own.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are not able to change the account type after you make your selection, so be sure to choose the right type.  

Here are the essential differences between the two account types.  

| Individual account | Company account |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Individual account is usually appropriate for individual developer working alone | Company account is intended for organizations and businesses |  
| Shorter account verification process | Greater account verification to confirm that you have authorization to set up the account for your company |  

## Account Verification  

After you complete the registration process, your account is verified.  For individual accounts, we check the availability of your publisher display name.  For company accounts, the process takes a little longer, as we also need to confirm that you have authorization to set up the account for your company.  The duration of the verification process ranges from a few days to a couple of weeks, and your company may receive a phone call from our verification partner.  Your company account must be verified before you submit your Extension.  While you wait for verification; you should continue build, test, and prepare your submissions.  

You may check your verification status on the **Account settings** page.
