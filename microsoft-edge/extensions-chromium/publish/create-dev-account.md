# Register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer  

To submit your extension to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store, you must be registered as a developer with the Microsoft Edge program.  The Microsoft Edge program is located on [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is no registration fee involved in submitting extensions to the Microsoft Edge program.  

## Before you begin  

If you don't have an account or if you have an existing commercial account with Partner Center, create a new [Microsoft account (MSA)][WindowsCommunityEverythingAboutMicrosoftAccounts] to register with the Microsoft Edge program.  To create a Microsoft account \(Outlook/live/Hotmail\), complete the following actions.  

1.  Navigate to [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount].  
1.  Choose **Create a Microsoft account**.  
    
If you have a developer account registered on Partner center, use the corresponding Microsoft account \(MSA\) to sign into your developer account, and then enroll in the Microsoft Edge program.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can link your work account on Partner Center to manage your Edge extensions. For this, you first need to register to the Microsoft Edge program on the Partner Center using a Microsoft Personal account. Follow the steps mentioned here to register, if you haven't already done so. Once registered, navigate to **Tenants** under **Account settings** and select either **Associate your Azure AD account with Partner center** or **Create a new Azure AD**.


If you are enrolled to some other program on Partner center, login with the Admin credentials of your work account and enroll into the Edge program using the same credentials.



## Enroll in the Microsoft Edge program on Partner Center  

1.  Navigate to the [developer page][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and choose **GO TO DASHBOARD**.  
1.  If you have a Microsoft account, sign into it now.  If not, create a new Microsoft account.  Use the same Microsoft account that you use to sign into your developer account.  After you sign in, a registration form is displayed. The following table describes the fields on the registration form.  
    
    To enroll in the Microsoft Edge program, sign in-to your account, and complete the form.  
    
    :::row:::
       :::column span="1":::
          **Account country/region**  
       :::column-end:::
       :::column span="2":::
          This field is where you either live or your business is located.  
          
          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > After enrollment, the value of this field is read-only.

       :::column span="2":::
          The Microsoft Edge program in [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] offers both individual and company accounts.  The accounts are described in detail in the following bullets.  Both account types allow you to publish extensions to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.  
          
          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > After enrollment, you are not able to change the value of this field.  
          
          *   `Individual account`  
              An individual account is appropriate for a developer not associated with a company.  The account verification process is shorter, and involves verifying that the publisher display name is available.  

          *   `Company account`  
              A company account is associated with an organization or business.  The account verification process is longer, and involves confirmation that you are authorized to create the account for your company.  The duration of the process may range from a few days to a few weeks.  Your company may receive phone calls from Microsoft verification partners.

       :::column span="2":::
          This field contains the name that displays in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.  You may use a name only if it's available, and you have the rights to use it.  Company accounts must use the registered business name of your organization.  
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > The maximum length for this field is 50 characters.

       :::column span="1":::
          **Contact details**  
       :::column-end:::
       :::column span="2":::
          This field contains any contact information that Microsoft uses to contact you about any account issues.  After registration is complete, an email confirmation is sent to you.  For a company account, you must use the registered email address associated with your organization.  
       :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::  
    :::row:::
       :::column span="1":::
          **Company approver**

          For a company account, you must provide the contact information of your company approver.  The contact information includes name, email address, and phone number.  Microsoft contacts the company approver specified as a part of the verification process to ensure your extension belongs to your organization.
