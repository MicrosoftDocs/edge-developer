# Register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer  

To submit your extension to the Microsoft Edge add-ons website, you must be registered as a developer with the Microsoft Edge program on [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].  There is no registration fee involved in submitting extensions to the Microsoft Edge program.  

## Before you begin  

If you do not have an account or if you have an existing commercial account with Partner Center, you must create a new [Microsoft account (MSA)][WindowsCommunityEverythingAboutMicrosoftAccounts] to register with the Microsoft Edge program.  To create a Microsoft account \(Outlook/live/Hotmail\), visit [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount] and select **Create a Microsoft account**.  If you are registered on the Partner center with a developer account, use the corresponding Microsoft account \(MSA\) to sign-in, and then enroll in the Microsoft Edge program.  

> [!NOTE]
> Today the Microsoft Edge extensions team does not support signing up with a work or school account.  In the future, the Microsoft Edge extensions team plans to support linking AAD tenants to MSA accounts for extension management.  

## Enroll in the Microsoft Edge program on Partner Center  

1.  Go to the [developer page][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and select **GO TO DASHBOARD**.  
1.  If you are not already signed in with a **Microsoft account**, sign-in now, or create a new Microsoft account.  You use the same Microsoft account that you use to sign into your developer account.  After you sign-in, this registration form is displayed.  
    
    To enroll in the Microsoft Edge program, sign in-to your account, and complete the form.
