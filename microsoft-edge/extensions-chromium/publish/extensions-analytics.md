# View Microsoft Edge extensions analytics dashboard

Microsoft announced the launch of the Extensions Analytics Dashboard on September 8, 2021. For more information, see the [Track your add-on's performance: extension analytics now available on Partner center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/track-your-add-on-s-performance-extension-analytics-now/m-p/2733351) blog post.

You can view extension metrics from your [Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/overview) and evaluate an extension's performance from [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home).

For example, you can identify regions in which the number of installations for your extension has increased in the past three months. You can also export this report as a CSV file.

Follow these steps to view your extension's analytics dashboard:  

1. Go to your Partner Center account and select an extension.

1. From the left panel, click **Extension overview** > **Analytics** to view your extension metrics.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Analytics dashboard metrics

From the analytics dashboard you can view metrics for the **Last month**, **3 months**, **6 months**, or **All time** (the period since your extension has been published to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Weekly users

The **Weekly users** metric tracks the number of users that have your extension turned on, turned off and status unknown on Microsoft Edge over the past seven days.

The following screenshot shows the **Weekly users** from the date the extension was published until the day the report was run on February 18.

<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Enabled vs Disabled

The **Enabled vs Disabled** report shows the number of instances of the extension that are enabled or disabled per user.

The following screenshot shows the **Weekly users** who have enabled and disabled the extension over the same period. You can choose from **Select all** / **Unselect all**, **Disabled**, and **Enabled** views.

#### Installs

The **Installs** metric displays the total number of successful installs of your extensions per day from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.

The following screenshot shows daily successful installations for the last month.

#### Impressions

The **Impressions** metric captures the total number of page views and user visits to your extension product page on Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. The data points are based on weekly or daily totals depending on the selected time range.

#### Region

The Region filter covers the geographical distribution of users for your extension, indicating the user base in each region.
