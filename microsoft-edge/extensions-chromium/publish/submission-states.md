# Extension submission states and overview  

The overview page on the Partner Center displays the state of your extension in the overall submission flow.  

| # |  State |  Description / Details |  
|:--- |:--- |:--- |  
| 1 |  In draft |  After you create your submission and save it to your account, the state changes to this state.  <br />  You have not submitted your extension package and your submission form details for publishing on Microsoft Store.  <br />  Your extension is not available to users in this state.  |  
| 2|  In review |  After you submit your extension, the state changes to this state.  <br />  Your extension package and your submission form details are under review by Microsoft.  <br />  Your extension is not available to users in this state.  |  
| 3|  Waiting to publish |  After your extension review is successfully completed and while your extension is being prepared for publishing to Microsoft Store, the state changes to this state.  <br />  This is an intermediate state between `In review` and `In the store`.  <br />  This state may not appear for all the submissions.  |  
| 4|  In the store |  After the review completes and your extension is published to Microsoft Store, the state changes to this state.  <br />  Your extension is available on Microsoft Store in markets that you specified.  |  
| 5 |  In the store.  Update in review |  Your extension is published on Microsoft Store and you have submitted an update that is under review by Microsoft.  |  
| 6 |  Review failed |  If your extension fails a review, the state changes to this state.  <br />  A failed review may occur during initial review or during an update.  <br />  You are expected to take corrective action and re-submit your extension for publishing on Microsoft Store.  |  
| 7 |  Unavailable in store |  There are three possible scenarios when your extension displays this state:  **Unpublished from store** , **Removed from store**, and **Blocked**.  The description of each of these three is specified below.  |  
| 8 |  Unpublished from store |  You unpublished your extension from Microsoft Store in Partner Center.  <br />  In Partner Center, on your extension submission page, you clicked on unpublish button.  <br />  After unpublishing, your extension is no longer available on Microsoft Store for new users to download, but existing users may continue to use their copies of your extension.  |  
| 9 |  Removed from store |  If your extension is found to violate the terms and conditions of Microsoft Store, Microsoft may remove it from Microsoft Store and the state changes to this state.  <br />  After removal of your extension by Microsoft, your extension is no longer available on Microsoft Store for new users to download, but existing users may continue to use their copies of your extension.  |  
| 10 |  Blocked |  If your extension is found to be malicious and compromising security and privacy of users, Microsoft has the right to block your extension from Microsoft Store and the state changes to this state.  <br />  If your extension is blocked, your extension is removed from Microsoft Store, your extension is also removed from user devices.  |
