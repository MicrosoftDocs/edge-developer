# Sample: Display an image in a pop-up

This sample is a simple static extension, without JavaScript, that displays the `stars.jpeg` image in a small webpage in a pop-up in any Microsoft Edge tab:

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Clone the MicrosoftEdge-Extensions repo

<!-- for all extensions samples, this is the main copy to propagate copy/paste/modify.  put comments on lines that vary per-sample -->
You can use various tools to clone a GitHub repo.  You can download a selected directory, or clone the entire repo.  These instructions use GitHub Desktop to clone the repo and switch to a working branch.

To clone the `MicrosoftEdge-Extensions` repo to your local drive:

1. If not done already, install GitHub desktop: go to [https://github.com/apps/desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop), and then click the **Download now** button.

1. Go to [MicrosoftEdge-Extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions).

1. Click the **Code** button, and then select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.

   A dialog opens, saying **This site is trying to open GitHubDesktop.exe.**

1. Click the **Open** button.

   GitHub Desktop opens, with the **MicrosoftEdge-Extensions** repo selected in the upper left dropdown list.

   Or, in GitHub Desktop, the **Clone a repository** dialog opens: 

   ![The "Clone a repository" dialog in GitHub Desktop](./part1-simple-extension-images/clone-a-repo-dbox-ghd.png)

1. Specify the local drive path to place the cloned repo directory into; for example: `C:\Users\accountname\GitHub\`.

1. Click the **Clone** button.


   **Create working branch:**

1. In GitHub Desktop, make sure that in the upper left of GitHub desktop, **Current repository** is **MicrosoftEdge-Extensions**.

   In the **Current branch** drop-down list, it says **main**.

1. In the **Current branch** drop-down list, click the **Branches** tab, and then click the **New branch** button.

   The **Create a branch** dialog opens.

1. In the **Name** text box, enter a branch name, such as **ext-sample-1**, and then click the **Create branch** button.

   In the upper middle and lower left of GitHub Desktop, the current branch is shown, such as **ext-sample-1**.

You are now free to modify the code in your working branch, without altering the code that's in the "main" branch of the repo.  Later you might want to switch back to the "main" branch, or create a different branch based off the "main" branch.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Install the sample locally

Instead of installing the sample from the Store, you'll install the sample locally, so that you can possibly modify it and quickly test the changes.  Installing locally is sometimes called _sideloading_ an extension.

1. In Microsoft Edge, click the **Extensions** (![Extensions icon](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-icon.png)) button, next to the Address bar, if this icon is displayed.  Or, select **Settings and more** (...) > **Extensions**.  The **Extensions** pop-up opens:

   ![The Extensions popup when no extensions are installed](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-popup-no-extensions.png)

1. Click **Manage extensions**.  The **Extensions** management page opens in a new tab:

   ![Turning on Developer Mode](./part1-simple-extension-images/developermode-toggle.png)

1. Turn on the **Developer mode** toggle.

1. When installing your extension for the first time, click the **Load unpacked** (![The "Load unpacked" icon](./part1-simple-extension-images/load-unpacked-icon.png)) button.  The **Select the extension directory** dialog opens.

1. Select the directory that contains the extension's source files, such as `manifest.json`, and then click the **Select Folder** button.

   Example path:

   `C:\Users\myUsername\GitHub\MicrosoftEdge-Extensions\Extension samples\extension-getting-started-part1\part1\`

   The extension is installed in the browser, similar to an extension that's installed from the store:

   ![Installed extensions page, showing a sideloaded extension](./part1-simple-extension-images/part1-installed-extension.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Run the sample

1. Go to a webpage, such as [TODO app](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/demo-to-do/)<!-- https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/demo-to-do -->, in a new window or tab.  For this sample, this step is optional and is just to match the screenshots; this sample doesn't require a webpage to be open.

1. In the upper right of Microsoft Edge, click the **Extensions** (![Extensions icon](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-icon.png)) button.  Or, select **Settings and more** (...) > **Extensions**.

   The **Extensions** pop-up opens:

   ![The Extensions pop-up](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-popup.png)

1. Click the extension's icon or name (**NASA picture of the day pop-up**).

   The extension opens, and the extension's icon is added next to the Address bar and **Extensions** (![Extensions icon](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-icon.png)) icon.  The extension displays `popup.html`, containing `stars.jpeg`, in a pop-up:

   ![The simple extension running](./part1-simple-extension-images/extension-running.png)<!-- 2nd use of this png -->

   You can open this particular sample extension in any tab, including an empty tab or the **Manage Extensions** tab.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Study the sample

In the following sections, you study the sample.  After that, to develop your own Microsoft Edge extension, you can copy and modify the sample's directory, and install and test the resulting extension.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Files and directories

The sample has the following directory structure:

Example path for the sample:
`C:\Users\localAccount\GitHub\MicrosoftEdge-Extensions\Extension samples\extension-getting-started-part1\part1\`

Directories and files in the `\part1\` directory:

```shell
/icons/
   nasapod16x16.png
   nasapod32x32.png
   nasapod48x48.png
   nasapod128x128.png
/images/
   stars.jpeg
/popup/
   popup.html
manifest.json
```

* The `/icons/` directory contains versions of a `.png` file that's used to represent the extension near the browser's Address bar.
* The `/images/` directory contains `stars.jpeg`, which is displayed in the extension's pop-up.
* The `/popup/` directory contains `popup.html`, which defines the webpage content that's displayed in the extension's pop-up.
* `manifest.json` contains basic information about the extension.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## The manifest file (`manifest.json`)

Every extension package must have a `manifest.json` file at the root.  The manifest provides details of your extension, the extension package version, and the extension name and description.

`manifest.json` contains the following lines:

```json
{
  "name": "NASA picture of the day pop-up",
  "version": "0.0.0.1",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "description": "A basic extension that displays an image in a pop-up.",
  "icons": {
      "16": "icons/nasapod16x16.png",
      "32": "icons/nasapod32x32.png",
      "48": "icons/nasapod48x48.png",
      "128": "icons/nasapod128x128.png"
  },
  "action": {
      "default_popup": "popup/popup.html"
  }
}
```


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Icons for launching the extension

The `/icons/` directory contains the icon image files.  The icons are used as the background image for the button that you click to launch the extension:

![The extension's icon in the Extensions pop-up list](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-popup-with-launch-icon.png)
<!-- ~~ -->

When the extension is running, one of the icons is displayed on the toolbar, next to the Address bar:

![Icon on the toolbar](./part1-simple-extension-images/icon-png-toolbar.png)

To close the extension, click the extension's icon on the toolbar, or click the **Extensions** (![Extensions icon](./part1-simple-extension-images/extensions-icon.png)) button.

Recommendations for icons:
* Use `PNG` format, but you can also use `BMP`, `GIF`, `ICO` or `JPEG` formats.
* If you provide a single icon file, use 128 x 128 px, which can be resized by the browser if necessary.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## The pop-up dialog (`popup.html`)

`popup.html` in the `popup` directory runs when you launch the extension.  When you click the icon to launch the extension, this file is displayed as a modal dialog.

`popup.html` contains the following code, to display a title and the stars image:

```html
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>NASA picture of the day</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <img src="/images/stars.jpeg" alt="Stars" />
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

The popup (`popup.html`) is registered as the `"default_popup"` in `manifest.json`, in the `action` key section:

`manifest.json` (portion)

```json
{
    ...
    "action": {
        "default_popup": "popup/popup.html"
    }
}
```


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Next steps

To develop your own Microsoft Edge extension, you can copy and modify the sample's directory, and install and test the resulting extension.

After running and testing this extension sample, you can continue on to [Sample: Insert an image in the webpage](./part2-content-scripts.md), which dynamically inserts JavaScript running as content in the browser tab.
