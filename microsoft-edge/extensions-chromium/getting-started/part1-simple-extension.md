# Create an extension tutorial - Part 1


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Overview

The goal for this tutorial is to build a Microsoft Edge extension, starting with an empty directory.  You are building an extension that pops up the NASA picture of the day.  In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an extension by:

*   Creating a `manifest.json` file.
*   Adding icons.
*   Opening a default pop-up dialog.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Before you begin

To test out the completed extension that you are building in this tutorial, download the [source code](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions-Demos/tree/master/extension-getting-started-part1/part1).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 1: Create a manifest.json file

Every extension package must have a `manifest.json` file at the root.  The manifest provides details of your extension, the extension package version, the extension name and description, and so on.

The following code snippet outlines the basic information needed in your `manifest.json` file.

```json
{
    "name": "NASA picture of the day viewer",
    "version": "0.0.0.1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "description": "An extension to display the NASA picture of the day."
}
```


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 2: Add icons

Start by creating the `icons` directory in your project to store the icon image files.  The icons are used for the background image of the button that users select to launch the extension.

:::image type="complex" source="./media/part1-badge1.png" alt-text="Icon on the toolbar to open your extension":::
   Icon on the toolbar to open your extension
:::image-end:::

For icons, we recommend using:
*   `PNG` format for icons, but you may also use `BMP`, `GIF`, `ICO` or `JPEG` formats.
*   Images that are 128 x 128 px, which are resized by the browser if necessary.

The directories of your project should be similar to the following structure.

```shell
└── part1
    ├── _manifest.json
    └── icons
        ├── nasapod16x16.png
        ├── nasapod32x32.png
        ├── nasapod48x48.png
        └── nasapod128x128.png
```

Next, add the icons to the `manifest.json` file. Update your `manifest.json` file with the icons information so that it matches the following code snippet. The `png` files listed in the following code are available in the download file mentioned earlier in this article.

```json
{
    "name": "NASA picture of the day viewer",
    "version": "0.0.0.1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "description": "An extension to display the NASA picture of the day.",
    "icons": {
        "16": "icons/nasapod16x16.png",
        "32": "icons/nasapod32x32.png",
        "48": "icons/nasapod48x48.png",
        "128": "icons/nasapod128x128.png"
    }
}
```


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 3: Open a default pop-up dialog

Now, create a `HTML` file to run when the user launches your extension.  Create the HTML file named `popup.html` in a directory named `popup`.  When users select the icon to launch the extension, `popup/popup.html` is displayed as a modal dialog.

Add the code from the following code snippet to `popup.html` to display the stars image.

```html
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>NASA picture of the day</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <img src="/images/stars.jpeg" alt="Display the stars image" />
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Ensure that you add the image file `images/stars.jpeg` to the images folder.  The directories of your project should be similar to the following structure.

```shell
└── part1
    ├── _manifest.json
    ├── icons
    │   ├── nasapod16x16.png
    │   ├── nasapod32x32.png
    │   ├── nasapod48x48.png
    │   └── nasapod128x128.png
    ├── images
    │   └── stars.jpeg
    └── popup
        └── popup.html
```

Finally, ensure you register the pop-up in `manifest.json` under `browser_action`, as shown in the following code snippet.

```json
{
    "name": "NASA picture of the day viewer",
    "version": "0.0.0.1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "description": "An extension to display the NASA picture of the day.",
    "icons": {
        "16": "icons/nasapod16x16.png",
        "32": "icons/nasapod32x32.png",
        "48": "icons/nasapod48x48.png",
        "128": "icons/nasapod128x128.png"
    },
    "browser_action": {
        "default_popup": "popup/popup.html"
    }
}
```

## Next steps
That is everything you need to develop a working extension.  Now, continue on to sideload and test your extension. For more information, navigate to [Sideload an extension](./extension-sideloading.md).
