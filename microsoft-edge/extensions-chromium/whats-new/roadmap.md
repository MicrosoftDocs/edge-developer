# Microsoft Edge Add-ons roadmap

This article describes the latest updates about new Partner Center features for Microsoft Edge extensions.

> [!NOTE]
> Released features for Microsoft [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/) change often. Partner Center continues to evolve based on market changes and customer feedback.  The features described in this article are also subject to change.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Features in development

The following features are actively being developed by our engineers.

### Publish and update extensions to Microsoft Edge Add-ons using APIs

Once this feature is available, you can integrate APIs directly into your Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  You can also publish extension package updates to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website without using Partner Center.

### Developers can respond to user reviews on their Microsoft Edge add-on

Developers can reply to the reviews and feedback received for their extension, on their Microsoft Edge add-on product page via Partner Center.

### Retirement of submitting new Microsoft Edge add-ons with Manifest V2

Microsoft Partner Center will no longer accept new Manifest V2 Microsoft Edge extension submissions, with visibility set as Hidden or Public.

### Addition of breadcrumbs to Microsoft Partner Center

Developers can view the navigation bar / tree path while using Partner Center to track the exact Partner Center path users are visiting. Developers can maintain awareness of their location within Microsoft Partner Center.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Features in backlog

The following features are currently in our backlog.

### Developers can add their contact information

For users to report extension specific issues through the extension webpage on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website. Developer support information will be shown on the product page of an extension. This information will allow users to directly reach out to the extension developer for extension-specific support.

### Manifest V2 Microsoft Edge add-ons deprecation

Microsoft Partner Center will not accept updates to existing Manifest V2 Microsoft Edge add-ons.  Microsoft Edge will no longer support or run Manifest V2 Microsoft Edge add-ons. Note that by using Microsoft Edge Enterprise Policies, Enterprise Accounts can allow Manifest V2 Microsoft Edge add-ons to run and operate on Microsoft Edge.

### Manifest V2 Microsoft Edge Enterprise add-ons cease to function
Microsoft Edge Enterprise add-ons with Manifest V2 will not be functional on Microsoft Edge.
