# Microsoft Edge Add-ons roadmap

This roadmap article describes the latest updates about new Partner Center features for Microsoft Edge extensions.  We update this information frequently, so be sure to check back often.

> [!NOTE]
> Released features for Microsoft [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) change often.  Partner Center continues to evolve based on market changes and customer feedback.  The features described in this article are also subject to change.

## Features and status

This table lists upcoming features and their current status.

| Feature description | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Publish and update extensions to Microsoft Edge Add-ons using APIs.**<br/>  Once this feature is available, you can integrate APIs directly into your Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  You can also publish extension package updates to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website without using Partner Center. | In development.<br/> This feature is actively being worked on by our engineers. |
| **Developers can add their contact information, for users to reach out and report extension specific issues through the extension webpage on the Edge Add-ons website.**<br/>  The developer support information will be shown on the product page of an extension.  This information will allow users to directly reach out to the extension developer for extension-specific support. | In pipeline.<br/> This feature is currently in our backlog. |
