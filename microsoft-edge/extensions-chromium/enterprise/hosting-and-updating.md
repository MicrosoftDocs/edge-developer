# Publish and update extensions in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website

Most extensions are published to the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons website](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/insider-addons/category/EdgeExtensions) to protect users from malicious extensions.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Publish options for extensions

All extensions are distributed to users as a special archive (`.zip`) file with a `.crx` suffix.  Extensions published to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website are uploaded as `.zip` files.  The publishing process automatically converts the `.zip` file into a `.crx` file.

The following two scenarios don't require you to publish your extension in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.

*   Extensions distributed using Enterprise policy.
*   Using unpacked extension directories on a local machine when Microsoft Edge is in developer mode.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Updates to extensions

The Microsoft Edge browser automatically checks for new versions of installed Extensions. Updates are installed without user intervention.
