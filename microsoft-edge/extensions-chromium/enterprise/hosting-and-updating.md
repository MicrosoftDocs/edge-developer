# Web Store Hosting and Updating  

Most Extensions are hosted in the [Microsoft Edge Insider Addons catalog \(Microsoft Edge Insider Addons\)][MicrosoftStoreExtensions] to best protect users from malicious Extensions.  

## Hosting  

All Extensions are distributed to users as a special ZIP file with a .crx suffix.  Extensions hosted in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons are uploaded as .zip files. The publishing process automatically converts the .zip into a .crx file.  

There are two exceptions to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons hosting rule:  

1.  Extensions that are distributed through the Enterprise policy.  
1.  Unpacked Extension directories from a local machine while in developer mode.  

## Updating  

The Microsoft Edge browser periodically checks for new versions of installed Extensions and updates each without user intervention.  

> [!NOTE]
> Steps to update an Extension on Microsoft Edge Add-ons are planned be added.
