# Microsoft Edge Addons Catalog Developer Policies  

## Introduction and Objective of this document  

Thank you for your interest in developing Extensions for the Microsoft Edge Addons catalog.  The Microsoft Edge Addons Catalog Developer Policies \(Addons Catalog Developer Policies\) apply to your Extensions, including your submission of Extensions through [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] and the provision of such Extensions through the Microsoft Edge Addons.  

## Principles  

A few principles to get you started:  

*   You should offer unique and distinct value within your Extensions for Microsoft Edge.  Provide a compelling reason to download your Extensions from the Microsoft Edge Addons catalog \(Microsoft Edge Addons\).  
*   You must not mislead our joint users about what your Extension does, who is offering it, and so on.  
*   You must not attempt to cheat users, the system or the ecosystem.  There is no place in our Microsoft Edge Addons for any kind of fraud; be it ratings and review manipulation, credit card fraud or other fraudulent activity.  

Adhering to these Addons Catalog Developer Policies should help you make choices that enhance the appeal and audience of your Extension.  

Your Extensions are crucial to the experience of hundreds of millions of users.  We look forward to experiencing what you create and are thrilled to help deliver your Extensions to the world.  

## 1. Product Policies  

### 1.1 Distinct Function & Value; Accurate Representation

Your Extension must have a single purpose with narrow functionality.  

#### 1.1.2 Describe your Extension  

All aspects of your Extension should accurately describe the functions, features and any important limitations of your Extension, including required or supported input devices.  The value proposition of your Extension must be clear during the first run experience.  Your Extension may not use a name or icon similar to that of other Extensions, and must not claim to represent a company, government body, or other entity if you do not have permission to make that representation.  

#### 1.1.3 Functionality  

Your Extension must be fully functional.  

#### 1.1.4 Search and Discovery

#### 1.1.8 Altering Browser Settings  

Your Extension must **not, without appropriate user consent**, alter, or appear to alter, browser functionality or settings including, but not limited to: the address bar search provider and suggestions, the start or home page, the new tab page, and adding or removing favourite.  

Any alteration to the browser settings should be explicitly documented in the description of the Extension.  

Your Extension may only revise key settings to replace a Microsoft webpage or service with that of a third-party \(such as require use of a third-party search engine or set the home page to a third-party web property\) if you are employed by or otherwise associated with such third-party.  

### 1.2 Security  

Your Extension must not jeopardize or compromise user security, or the security or functionality of the device, system or related systems.  

#### 1.2.1 Content Security Policies  

> [!NOTE]
> If you make any changes to your Extension beyond the described functionality, any changes to code must be compliant with the [Microsoft Edge content security policy][MicrosoftEdgeContentSecurityPolicyRemoteScript].  Example: Your Extension should not download a remote script and subsequently run that script in a manner that is not consistent with the described functionality.  

#### 1.2.2 Unwanted and Malicious Software  

Your Extension must not contain or enable malware as defined by the Microsoft criteria for [Unwanted and Malicious Software][MicrosoftIdentifiesMalwareUnwantedApplications].  

#### 1.2.3 Dependency on other software

#### 1.5.3 Sharing data with third parties  

You may publish the Personal Information of users of your Extension to an outside service or third-party through your Extension or associated metadata only after obtaining opt-in consent from those users.

*   Describe to your users how the information is accessed, used or shared and indicate the types of parties to whom it is disclosed, and  
*   Provide your users a mechanism in the Extension user interface through which they have the option to later rescind the permission and opt-out.

Your Extension must also obtain express user consent before collecting, storing, or transmitting such information.  

### 1.6 Permissions

You should localize your Extension for all languages that the Extension claims to support.  The text of the description of your Extension should be localized in each language that you declare.  
If your Extension is localized such that some features are not available in a localized version, you must clearly state or display the limits of localization in the Extension description. The experience provided by an Extension must be reasonably similar in all languages that it supports.  

### 1.8 Financial Transactions  

If your product includes in-product purchase, subscriptions, virtual currency, billing functionality, or captures financial information; the requirements in the following sections apply.  

#### 1.8.1 Paid Features  

Your Extension may enable users to consume digital content or services purchased through a third-party purchase mechanism or API.  

You must use a secure third-party purchase API for purchases of physical goods or services.  You must use a secure third-party purchase API for payments made in connection with any other services including real world gambling or charitable contributions.

The following requirements apply to your use of a secure third-party purchase API:  

*   At the time of the transaction or when you collect any payment or financial information from the user; your Extension must identify the commerce transaction provider, authenticate the user, and obtain user confirmation for the transaction.  A commerce transaction provider maintains a secure platform for financial exchanges.  
*   Your Extension may offer users the ability to save this authentication, but users must have the ability to either require an authentication on every transaction or to turn off in-product transactions.  
*   If your Extension collects credit card information or uses a third-party payment processor that collects credit card information, the payment processing must meet the current PCI Data Security Standard \(PCI DSS\).  

#### 1.8.2 Disclosing paid features  

Your Extension and associated metadata must provide information about the types of in-product purchases offered and the range of prices.  You must not mislead users and must be clear about the nature of your in-product promotions and offerings including the scope and terms of any trial experiences.  If your Extension restricts access to user-created content during or after a trial, you must notify users in advance.  In addition, your Extension must make it clear to users that they are initiating a purchase option in the Extension.  

### 1.9 Notifications  

Your Extension must respect system settings for notifications.  This means any presentation of ads and notifications to users must be consistent with user preferences, regardless of whether the notifications are provided by the Microsoft Push Notification Service \(MPNS\), Windows Push Notification Service \(WNS\), or any other service.

If your product uses MPNS or WNS to transmit notifications, it must comply with the following requirements:  

#### 1.9.1 General Guidance  

Notifications provided through WNS or MPNS are considered product content and are subject to all Addons Catalog Developer Policies.
