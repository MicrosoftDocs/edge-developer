# Microsoft Edge Add-ons store developer policies


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Introduction and Objective of this document

Thank you for your interest in developing extensions for the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.  The Microsoft Edge Add-ons store developer policies (Add-ons store developer policies) apply to your extensions, including your submission of extensions through [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/public/login?ref=dd) and the provision of such extensions through the Microsoft Edge Add-ons.

The _Microsoft Edge Add-ons store_ is also called the _Microsoft Edge Add-ons website_.  The _Microsoft Edge Add-ons store developer policies_ are also called the _Microsoft Edge Add-ons website developer policies_.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Principles

A few principles to get you started:

*   You should offer unique and distinct value within your extensions for Microsoft Edge.  Provide a compelling reason to download your extensions from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store (Microsoft Edge Add-ons).
*   You must not mislead our joint users about what your extension does, who is offering it, and so on.
*   You must not attempt to cheat users, the system or the ecosystem.  There is no place in our Microsoft Edge Add-ons for any kind of fraud; be it ratings and review manipulation, credit card fraud or other fraudulent activity.

Adhering to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store developer policies should help you make choices that enhance the appeal and audience of your extension.

Your extensions are crucial to the experience of hundreds of millions of users.  We look forward to experiencing what you create and are thrilled to help deliver your extensions to the world.

#### 1.5.3 Sharing data with third parties

You may publish the Personal Information of users of your extension to an outside service or third-party through your extension or associated metadata only after obtaining opt-in consent from those users.

*   Provide your users a mechanism in your extension user interface through which they have the option to later rescind the permission and opt-out.

### 1.8 Financial Transactions

If your product includes in-product purchase, subscriptions, virtual currency, billing functionality, or captures financial information; the requirements in the following sections apply.

You must use a secure third-party purchase API for purchases of physical goods or services.  You must use a secure third-party purchase API for payments made in connection with any other services including real world gambling or charitable contributions.

A commerce transaction provider maintains a secure platform for financial exchanges.
*   Your extension may offer users the ability to save this authentication, but users must have the ability to either require an authentication on every transaction or to turn off in-product transactions.
*   If your extension collects credit card information or uses a third-party payment processor that collects credit card information, the payment processing must meet the current PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

#### 1.8.2 Disclosing paid features

Your extension and associated metadata must provide information about the types of in-product purchases offered and the range of prices.  You must not mislead users and must be clear about the nature of your in-product promotions and offerings including the scope and terms of any trial experiences.  If your extension restricts access to user-created content during or after a trial, you must notify users in advance.  In addition, your extension must make it clear to users that they are initiating a purchase option in your extension.

Your extension must respect system settings for notifications.
