# App Developer Agreement Addendum for Microsoft Edge program users


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Exhibit G: Terms and Conditions for Microsoft Edge Extensions

These Terms and Conditions for Microsoft Edge Extensions (the "Extensions Addendum") is a supplement to the terms and conditions of the App Developer Agreement, the current version of which can be found at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=221922](./developer-policies.md).  This Addendum applies if you have submitted or are making available Microsoft Edge Extensions (each, an "Extension") through Microsoft Edge Add-ons.  Except as expressly modified by this Extensions Addendum, all of the terms and conditions in the App Developer Agreement, which is incorporated by reference herein, apply to the offering and distribution of your Microsoft Edge Extensions.  Except where expressly modified by this Addendum, the terms and conditions that apply to an "Application" or "App" under the App Developer Agreement will apply to an Extension as defined in this Addendum and all references to "Store" or "Microsoft Store" under the App Developer Agreement will apply to Microsoft Edge Add-ons as defined in this Addendum.

1.  DEFINITIONS.  Capitalized terms not defined herein will have the meanings provided in the App Developer Agreement.

    1.  "Certification Requirements" means the technical, functional, content, and other policy requirements provided by Microsoft (at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2104222](./developer-policies.md), or another location(s) specified by Microsoft) for Extensions offered through Microsoft Edge Add-ons.

    1.  "Microsoft Edge Add-ons" means a Microsoft owned or operated platform, however named, through which Microsoft Edge Extensions may be offered to or acquired by Customers.

1.  SUBMISSION, CERTIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF APPS.  Section 3 of the App Developer Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced by the following:

    1.  Submission.  You must submit to Microsoft each Extension that you wish to make available through Microsoft Edge Add-ons, including any updates to each Extension.  You are solely responsible and liable for the Extensions you submit.  You are responsible for supporting your extension.  Microsoft will retain (or destroy) all copies of the Extension and other materials you submit.  Microsoft will not return them, so you must maintain your own backup copies.

    1.  Updates to Extensions.  You may submit updates to Extensions for Certification and distribution through Microsoft Edge Add-ons.  Those updates are subject to all of the requirements of this Agreement.  You understand that end users may receive updates automatically.  You may not add any new functionality to your Extension via an update which requires written consent from the Customer without first providing notice to the Customer and obtaining any consents as may be required by law in the markets where you choose to distribute your Extension.

    1.  Initial Certification.  Microsoft will test each Extension (including any updates) you submit for compliance with this Agreement (which includes the applicable Certification Requirements) and other policies made available to you (if any).  Microsoft will not make any Extension available through Microsoft Edge Add-ons unless and until the Extension is Certified.

1.  AFFIRMATIVE DECLINE NOT REQUIRED.  Notwithstanding Section 4(i) of the App Developer Agreement, you are not required to affirmatively decline participation in Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education.  Your Extension will only be available through the Microsoft Edge Add-ons.

1.  APP PRICING, PAYMENTS, TRANSACTIONS AND TAXES.  Section 6 of the App Developer Agreement does not apply to Extensions and is hereby deleted in its entirety.
