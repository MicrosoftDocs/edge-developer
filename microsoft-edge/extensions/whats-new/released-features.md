# Released features for Microsoft Edge extensions
<!-- https://aka.ms/EdgeAddonsReleaseNotes -->

The following features or updates have been launched on [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/) for Microsoft Edge extensions.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Transfer ownership of a Microsoft Edge extension

As an extension developer, you can now seamlessly transfer ownership of your Microsoft Edge extension to another party, such as for organizational changes, project handovers, or streamlining management processes.  See [Transfer ownership of an extension](../update/transfer-ownership.md).

*Released February 2025*


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Sidebar

The sidebar feature of Microsoft Edge extensions enables an extension to display custom UI content in the browser sidebar.  See [Develop an extension for the Microsoft Edge sidebar](../developer-guide/sidebar.md).

*Released June 2023*


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Retirement of submitting new Microsoft Edge extensions with Manifest V2

Microsoft Partner Center only accepts new Manifest V3 Microsoft Edge extension submissions, with visibility set as 'Hidden' or 'Public'.  To share your feedback and comments, see [Update your extensions from Manifest V2 to V3](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/discussions/27) in **Discussions** in the MicrosoftEdge-Extensions repo.

*Released July 2022*

## You can respond to user reviews about your Microsoft Edge extension

At Partner Center, you can reply to user reviews and feedback about your extension that's posted at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com). 

To share your feedback and comments about this feature, see [You can now respond to user reviews on your Microsoft Edge Add-ons page](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/discussions/18) in **Discussions** in the MicrosoftEdge-Extensions repo.

*Released May 2022*


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Update an extension by using the Microsoft Edge Add-ons API

You can integrate REST API endpoints directly into your continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, to publish extension package updates at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com) without using Partner Center.  For more information, see [Use the REST API to update an extension at Microsoft Edge Add-ons](../update/api/using-addons-api.md).

*Released March 2022*

Update September 2024: v1.1 of this REST API provides increased security.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Addition of breadcrumbs to Microsoft Partner Center

You can view the navigation bar / tree path while using Partner Center to track the exact Partner Center path that users are visiting.  You can maintain awareness of your location within Microsoft Partner Center.

*Released March 2022*


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Microsoft Edge extensions developer portal

The new edition of the developer portal contains resources and documentation for Microsoft Edge extensions.  Go to [Microsoft Edge Add-ons Developer](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/extensions/).

## Extension Analytics Dashboard on Microsoft Partner Center
