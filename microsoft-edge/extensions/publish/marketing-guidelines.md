A Microsoft Edge Add-on badge is a visual asset designed to help you promote Edge Add-ons and build user trust.

The Microsoft Edge Add-on badge lets you showcase your extensions with Edge-specific branding.  To prevent confusion with the broader Microsoft Store, the Microsoft Edge Add-on badge is intended exclusively for promoting add-ons (such as extensions, themes, or web apps) that are available for Microsoft Edge.  This badge helps users clearly identify content that is built specifically for the Microsoft Edge browser.

Unlike generic Microsoft Store badges<!-- todo: link and/or show .png --> â€” the Microsoft Edge Add-on badge<!-- todo: the Featured badge? --> provides a distinct, trusted visual cue that connects your add-on directly to the Microsoft Edge ecosystem.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Minimum sizes

* To ensure the badge text remains readable, display it at a minimum size 32px.  Avoid using smaller sizes.  When scaling the badge, always maintain its aspect ratio; do not stretch or compress the badge image.  This helps preserve visual quality and reinforces your product's Credibility.<!-- todo: credibility? -->

These badges are available in 41<!-- todo: many --> languages.  Follow the required specifications for image usage, fonts, and color palette.  For detailed usage examples and guidelines, see the [Microsoft Store Badge Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/blob/main/assets/microsoft-store-badge-guidelines.pdf)<!-- todo: match dest title --> PDF file.

Always use the official badge artwork provided by Microsoft.

Do not create your own version, alter the text color, extract the Microsoft Edge logo, or modify the badge in any way.

Do not animate, rotate, tilt, stretch, compress, or apply gradients or shadows to the badge.

Do not use the badge as a decorative element in any context.

The badge must always be an active, clickable link that directs users to your extension page on the Add-ons store.

Do not use the badge in static marketing materials, such as posters, flyers, or non-clickable images in presentations or videos.

The badge is intended solely to facilitate direct access to your content on the Edge Add-ons platform.
