# Marketing guidelines for the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge
<!-- https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/publish/app-marketing-guidelines -->

_Microsoft Edge Add-ons_ include extensions, themes, and web apps.  You publish Microsoft Edge Add-ons at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/).

To promote your Microsoft Edge Add-ons, use the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge in your websites, documentation, tutorials, and other services or integrations.  This ensures consistent, accessible, and compliant representation of the Microsoft Edge Add-ons brand.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is a visual asset designed to help you promote your Microsoft Edge Add-ons and build user trust.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge appears in full color with a dark background, and includes a gray border.  The badge `.png` files are provided in 41 languages.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge lets you showcase your Microsoft Edge Add-ons with Microsoft Edge-specific branding.  To prevent confusion with the broader [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com), the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is intended exclusively 
for promoting <!--todo-->add-ons (extensions, themes, or web apps) that are available for Microsoft Edge.  This badge helps users clearly identify content that is built specifically for the Microsoft Edge browser.

Unlike generic Microsoft [Store badges](/windows/apps/publish/app-marketing-guidelines#store-badges), the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge provides a distinct, trusted 
visual cue that connects your add-ons directly to the Microsoft Edge ecosystem.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is not the same as the Microsoft brand logo, and they cannot be used interchangeably.
