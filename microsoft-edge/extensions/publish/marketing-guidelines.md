# Marketing guidelines for Microsoft Edge Add-ons
<!-- https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/publish/app-marketing-guidelines -->
<!-- focus concretely on "badge", though potentially can broaden later to cover add'l assets; at that time, can use more abstract umbrella wording -->

To promote your Microsoft Edge extension, use the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge in your websites, documentation, tutorials, and other services or integrations.  This ensures consistent, accessible, and compliant representation of the Microsoft Edge Add-ons brand.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is provided to you as a set of `.png` files in a `.zip` file; see [Download the badge image files](#download-the-badge-image-files) below.

## The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge
<!-- https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/publish/app-marketing-guidelines#store-badges -->

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is a visual asset designed to help you promote your Microsoft Edge Add-ons, such as extensions, and build user trust.  The badge `.png` files are provided in 41 languages.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge lets you showcase your extensions with Edge-specific branding.  To prevent confusion with the broader [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com), the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is intended exclusively for promoting add-ons (such as extensions, themes, or web apps) that are available for Microsoft Edge.  This badge helps users clearly identify content that is built specifically for the Microsoft Edge browser.

Unlike generic Microsoft [Store badges](/windows/apps/publish/app-marketing-guidelines#store-badges), the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge provides a distinct, trusted visual cue that connects your add-on directly to the Microsoft Edge ecosystem.

## Badge usage guidelines

Follow the required specifications for image usage, fonts, and color palette.  Detailed usage examples and guidelines are available in the downloadable PDF:

For example, here are some of the guidelines from the PDF:<!-- todo: review that statement -->

* Always use the official badge artwork provided by Microsoft.

* Do not create your own version, alter the text color, extract the Microsoft Edge logo, or modify the badge in any way.

* Do not animate, rotate, tilt, stretch, compress, or apply gradients or shadows to the badge.

* Do not use the badge as a decorative element in any context.

* The badge must always be an active, clickable link that directs users to your extension page at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/).

* Do not use the badge in static marketing materials, such as posters, flyers, or non-clickable images in presentations or videos.

* The badge is intended solely to facilitate direct access to your content on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons platform.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Minimum size for badges

To ensure that the badge text remains readable, display it at a minimum size of 32px.  Avoid using smaller sizes.

When scaling the badge, always maintain its aspect ratio; do not stretch or compress the badge image.  This helps preserve visual quality and reinforces your product's credibility.

## Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge vs. Microsoft brand logo

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is not the same as the Microsoft brand logo, and they cannot be used interchangeably.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge appears in full color with a dark background, and includes a gray border.
