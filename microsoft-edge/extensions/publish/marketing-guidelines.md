A Microsoft Edge Add-on badge is a visual asset designed to help you promote Edge Add-ons and build user trust.

The Microsoft Edge Add-on badge lets you showcase your extensions with Edge-specific branding.  To prevent confusion with the broader [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com), the Microsoft Edge Add-on badge is intended exclusively for promoting add-ons (such as extensions, themes, or web apps) that are available for Microsoft Edge.  This badge helps users clearly identify content that is built specifically for the Microsoft Edge browser.

Unlike generic Microsoft Store badges,<!-- todo: .png(s) --> the Microsoft Edge Add-on badge provides a distinct, trusted visual cue that connects your add-on directly to the Microsoft Edge ecosystem.
<!-- todo: which?
generic Microsoft Store badges - what's meant? show
the Microsoft Store logo - show, if relevant here
-->

Use the provided badges in the `.zip` file (below), rather than creating your own image files.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Minimum size for badges

To ensure that the badge text remains readable, display it at a minimum size of 32px.  Avoid using smaller sizes.

When scaling the badge, always maintain its aspect ratio; do not stretch or compress the badge image.  This helps preserve visual quality and reinforces your product's Credibility.<!-- todo: credibility? -->

Follow the required specifications for image usage, fonts, and color palette.  For detailed usage examples and guidelines, see the [Microsoft Store Badge Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/blob/main/assets/microsoft-store-badge-guidelines.pdf)<!-- todo: match dest title --> PDF file.

These badges are available in many languages.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Badge usage guidelines
<!-- todo: what kind of badges?
the Microsoft Edge Add-on badge
the Featured badge
-->

Always use the official badge artwork provided by Microsoft.

Do not create your own version, alter the text color, extract the Microsoft Edge logo, or modify the badge in any way.

Do not animate, rotate, tilt, stretch, compress, or apply gradients or shadows to the badge.

Do not use the badge as a decorative element in any context.

The badge must always be an active, clickable link that directs users to your extension page at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/).

Do not use the badge in static marketing materials, such as posters, flyers, or non-clickable images in presentations or videos.

The badge is intended solely to facilitate direct access to your content on the Edge Add-ons platform.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

## Microsoft Edge Add-on badge vs. Microsoft brand logo
