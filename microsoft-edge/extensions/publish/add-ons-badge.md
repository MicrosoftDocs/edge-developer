To promote your Microsoft Edge extension, theme, or web app, use the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge in your websites, documentation, tutorials, and other services or integrations.  This ensures consistent, accessible, and compliant representation of the Microsoft Edge Add-ons brand.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is a visual asset designed to help you promote your Microsoft Edge add-on and build user trust.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge reads **Get it from Microsoft Edge Add-ons**, and shows the Microsoft Edge logo:

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge appears in full color with a dark background, and includes a gray border and transparent corners.  The badge `.png` files are provided in 41 languages.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge lets you showcase your Microsoft Edge add-on with Microsoft Edge-specific branding.  To prevent confusion with the broader [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com), the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is intended exclusively for promoting add-ons that are available for Microsoft Edge.  This badge helps users clearly identify content that is built specifically for the Microsoft Edge browser.

The generic Microsoft Store badge reads **Get it from Microsoft**, and shows the Microsoft logo:

Unlike the generic Microsoft Store badge, the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge provides a distinct, trusted visual cue that connects your Microsoft Edge add-on directly to the Microsoft Edge ecosystem.

The Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is not the same as the Microsoft brand logo, and they cannot be used interchangeably.
