## Microsoft Edge Add-ons Badge

Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge is a visual asset designed to help you promote Edge Add-ons and build user trust.

Unlike generic Microsoft Store badges — the Microsoft Edge Add-ons badge provides a distinct, trusted visual cue that connects your add-ons such as extensions, webapps directly to the Edge ecosystem

#### Minimum sizes

* To ensure the badge text remains readable, display it at a minimum size 32px.  Avoid using smaller sizes.  When scaling the badge, always maintain its aspect ratio—do not stretch or compress it.  This helps preserve visual quality and reinforces your product's Credibility
