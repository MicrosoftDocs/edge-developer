> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for extensions for the [legacy version of Microsoft Edge][MicrosoftEdgeLegacy]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new Microsoft Edge program is now open to accept chromium-based extensions for the new Microsoft Edge (ver. 77 or above). If you want to submit a new extension, visit [Publish to Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) Addons Store][PublishMicrosoftEdgeAddonsCatalog] to learn about the submission process.  
> 
> With this announcement, Microsoft is no longer accepting new extensions for the [legacy version of Microsoft Edge][MicrosoftEdgeLegacy]. If you own an Extension for the legacy version, you should begin the process of porting your Extension to the new Microsoft Edge.  The new Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium, so Extensions designed for the legacy version of Microsoft Edge do not work with the new version.
