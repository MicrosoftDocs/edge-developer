# Using ManifoldJS to create extension AppX packages  

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../../includes/deprecation-note.md)]  

ManifoldJS is an open source Node.js tool that allows you to quickly and painlessly create a package that you can then use for submission to the Microsoft Store.  

If you use native messaging in your extension, you should skip the following article and go to [Native messaging in Microsoft Edge](../native-messaging.md#creating-an-extension-with-native-messaging) for packaging instruction.  

Before getting started, you will still need to read up on the following articles.  

*   [Extensions in the Windows Dev Center](./extensions-in-the-windows-dev-center.md)  
*   [Localizing extension packages](./localizing-extension-packages.md)  

> [!NOTE]
> Submitting a Microsoft Edge extension to the Microsoft Store is currently a restricted capability.  Once you have created, packaged and tested your extension, please submit a request on our [extension submission form](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/extensions/requests).  

## Installing Node.js and ManifoldJS  

The first things you will need to do is install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download).  
Once you have Node, from a command line (preferably PowerShell), run the following command to install ManifoldJS.  

```shell
npm install -g manifoldjs
```  

To verify that you have correctly installed ManifoldJS, run `manifoldjs` from the command line. If ManifoldJS was not recognized, add `%APPDATA%\npm` to your PATH variables.  

## Packaging with ManifoldJS  

To start the packaging process, you will need to open a command line and change directories to a folder that will be the destination for your packaged extension.  

For example:

```shell
cd C:\manifoldJSTest
```  

> [!NOTE]
> The `manifoldjs` command outputs in the current directory and overwrites content.  

Now that you are in your destination folder, run the following command.  

```shell
manifoldjs -l debug -p edgeextension -f edgeextension -m path\to\manifest.json
```  

The `mainifoldjs` command can be broken down into the following parts.  

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `-l debug`  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Changes the log level to `debug` to get a full print out.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::  
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `-p edgeextension`  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Sets the only platform to run the conversion on to `edgeextension`.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::  
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `-f edgeextension`  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Tells the program that the format of the manifest is an `edgeextension` format and not to care if it fails validation.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::  
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `-m \path\to\manifest.json`  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      The path to the extension manifest that you want to convert.  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::  

After ManifoldJS has finished running, you will have a folder with the following contents.  

```text
┌ My Extension
└┬ edgeextension
 ├- generationInfo.json
 └┬ manifest
  ├- appxmanifest.xml
  ├┬ Assets
  |├- Square150x150Logo.png
  |├- Square44x44Logo.png
  |└- StoreLogo.png    
  └┬ Extension
   ├- manifest.json
   └- popup.html
```  
<!-- 
    My Extension
        edgeextension
            generationInfo.json
            manifest
                   appxmanifest.xml
                Assets
                    Square150x150Logo.png
                    Square44x44Logo.png
                    StoreLogo.png    
                Extension
                    manifest.json
                    popup.html
                    ...
                ...
-->  

The generationInfo.json file is a log produced by running ManifoldJS and will not be included in your extension package. Only the contents of the `manifest` folder will be packaged. Within the manifest folder, the Assets folder contains the images that will be used in the Windows and Microsoft Store UI, while the Extension folder has the contents of your extension within it.  

Now that you have the correct files, you will need to edit the generated AppXManifest file within the `manifest` folder. If the extension’s manifest.json file has an internationalized string for the "name" field, once ManifoldJS is run, the most top layer folder’s name will have no underscores and include "MSG".

For example, a manifest.json file with the following `"name"` field.  

```shell
"name" : "__MSG_appName__"
```  

will have a manifest folder that lives in `\<CURRENT DIRECTORY>\MSGappName\edgeextension\manifest`.  

In the AppXManifest file, you will need to:  

 *   Replace the required Identity fields and PublisherDisplayName field as outlined [here](./creating-and-testing-extension-packages.md#app-identity-template-values). Note that if you are only packaging for testing purposes or for enterprise distribution, you can use placeholder values instead of registering for a Windows Dev Center account.  
 *   Replace the placeholder icons in the Assets folder with icons for your extension with the same sizes (150x150, 50x50, 44x44) and names. See the [Design](./../design.md#icons-for-packaging) guide for information about where these icons are used.  
 *   If your extension is localized, follow the entire [Localizing Microsoft Edge extensions](./localizing-extension-packages.md) guide. If it is not localized, only read the [Localizing name and description in the Microsoft Store](./localizing-extension-packages.md#localizing-name-and-description-in-the-microsoft-store) section.  

Once your `appxmanifest.xml` file is sorted out, run the following command to create your package.  

```shell
manifoldjs -l debug -p edgeextension package <EXTENSION NAME>\edgeextension\manifest\
```  

Your package will now be in the **package** folder located within the edgeextension folder. For more information about how to sideload your new package, see [testing](./creating-and-testing-extension-packages.md#testing-an-appx-package) section of Creating and testing extension packages.  

Once your package has been tested, feel free to submit a request on our [extension submission form](https://aka.ms/extension-request) in order to be considered for publication to the Microsoft Store.
