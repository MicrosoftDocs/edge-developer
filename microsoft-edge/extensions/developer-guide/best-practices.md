# Best practices for extensions

Follow these Best Practices to implement your extension and list it at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Design a high-quality extension

Build an extension that conforms to Microsoft's standards for security, privacy, transparency, and user experience.

**Security**: Make sure that your extension doesn't pose any security threats to users. 

**Privacy**: Make sure that your extension handles user data appropriately. 

**User experience**: Make sure that your extension provides a clean, intuitive, and seamless user experience on the web without ads that can be interruptive.

**Store listing**: Make sure that your extension's store listing sets correct user expectations and clearly communicates what the extension does.

We'll continue gathering input about Developer experiences with extensions, and updating these Best Practices.
