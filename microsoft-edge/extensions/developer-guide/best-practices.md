# Best practices for extensions

Follow these best practices to implement your extension and list it at [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com).  Build an extension that conforms to Microsoft's standards for security, privacy, transparency, and user experience.  These principles help ensure your extension is safe, reliable, and valuable to users.

The Microsoft Edge extensions team continues to gather feedback from developers and users to evolve these best practices.  To ensure that your extension remains compliant and competitive, review this guidance regularly.

Meeting these guidelines doesn't guarantee that your extension will receive the **Featured** badge; see [The Featured badge](../index.md#the-featured-badge) in _Overview of Microsoft Edge extensions_.

Follow these best practices, to improve the quality, reliability, and user experience of your extension, and to maximize your extension's visibility.
