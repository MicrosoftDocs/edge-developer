<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### About HoloLens 2, Unity, Mixed Reality Feature Tool, Mixed Reality Toolkit, and the WebView plugin

By combining HoloLens 2, Unity, the Mixed Reality Toolkit, and the WebView plugin for Unity, you can create immersive mixed-reality experiences that seamlessly integrate web content.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
###### HoloLens 2

**HoloLens 2** is a groundbreaking, untethered holographic device, offering a hands-free and immersive mixed reality experience. HoloLens 2 seamlessly overlays digital information onto the real world, rendering high-definition holograms that stay in place and respond naturally to interaction.

You can use the Unity game engine and Visual Studio to create your HoloLens 2 project.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
###### Unity

**Unity**, a versatile game engine, is a popular choice for creating 3D applications, including mixed reality experiences for HoloLens 2 devices, due to its extensive features and robust capabilities for augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR).


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
###### Mixed Reality Feature Tool (MRFT)

The **Mixed Reality Feature Tool (MRFT)** is a new way for developers to discover, update, and add mixed reality feature packages into Unity projects. You can search packages by name or category, see their dependencies, and even view proposed changes to your projects manifest file before importing. A manifest file is a JSON file defining all of your project's packages. Once you've validated the packages to be included, the Mixed Reality Feature tool will automatically download them into your selected Unity project.  This guide will use the MRFT to install the **Mixed Reality Toolkit** and the **Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity**.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
###### Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)

The **Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)** is a Microsoft-driven open-source project that accelerates the development of mixed reality applications in Unity by providing essential components and features for developing mixed reality experiences.  The MRTK provides a collection of scripts, components, and prefabs specifically designed to help you create performant and intuitive mixed reality experiences on HoloLens 2 devices.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
###### The Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity

The **Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity** enables the integration of WebView2 functionality into your HoloLens 2 app.  This WebView plugin for Unity simplifies the integration of WebView2 functionality into your HoloLens 2 app by wrapping the WebView2 control, automatically handling rendering, and automatically directing input to the WebView2 control.

This plugin also manages interop between Unity and WebView2, enabling communication between JavaScript and Unity via messages and events.

In Unity, the Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity can be installed by using the **Mixed Reality Feature Tool**.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 1 - Install Visual Studio

This tutorial assumes you have Unity 2021.3 LTS or later and Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later installed. Visual Studio 2017 isn't supported.  In this step we will start by setting up your Visual Studio environment for HoloLens 2 development, follow the [Mixed Reality tools installation guide](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools?tabs=unity). That article guides you through installing and configuring the necessary tools, including Visual Studio and the Universal Windows Platform development workload.

Also set up your development environment for WebView2, by following the steps in [Set up your Dev environment for WebView2](../how-to/machine-setup.md).

Once you have completed the setup, return to this page and continue with the next steps to get Unity installed.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 2 - Install Unity for HoloLens 2 development

Before you can start developing a HoloLens 2 app with WebView2, you will need to install Unity.  Follow the steps in [Choosing a Unity version and XR plugin](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/choosing-unity-version) to complete installation of the toolset that's needed to build mixed reality applications.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 3 - Configure the Unity project for Mixed Reality development

Once you have your tools installed, you're ready to create and configure your project.  The easiest way to get started with HoloLens 2 development is to use the Mixed Reality Toolkit in your project.  

The Mixed Reality Feature Tool simplifies the process of discovering, installing, and managing mixed reality features, including the Mixed Reality Toolkit, and packages for your Unity project. For more guidance on installing the Mixed Reality Feature Tool, see [Welcome to the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool).

1. First, [Download the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=102778) from the Microsoft Download Center.   

1. Run the downloaded Mixed Reality Feature Tool executable, and follow the prompts to install the Mixed Reality Toolkit and any additional required packages for HoloLens 2 development.

   The Mixed Reality Feature Tool allows you to select and install the appropriate versions of the Mixed Reality Toolkit, along with other mixed reality features, directly into your Unity project.

After you've used the Mixed Reality Feature Tool to install the Mixed Reality Toolkit, the toolkit's assets and prefabs will appear in your Unity project.  The Mixed Reality Toolkit will guide you through configuring the Open XR plugin for your project.

For a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of configuring the Unity project, see [Set up a new OpenXR project with MRTK](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/new-openxr-project-with-mrtk).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 4 - Install the WebView plugin for Unity by using the Mixed Reality Feature Tool

In this step, as above, you'll use the Mixed Reality Feature Tool to install the Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity.  This will install the specific version of the WebView2 NuGet package that's compatible with HoloLens 2.

1. Launch the Mixed Reality Feature Tool (which you installed above). The **Start** page of the Mixed Reality Feature Tool for Unity opens, containing options to configure settings and to view documentation:

   ![The Configure Settings button in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](./hololens2-images/mrtk_feature_tool_start_page.png)

1. Click the gear button.  The **Settings** pane opens.

1. Click the **Feature** tab, and then make sure the **Show preview releases** checkbox is selected:

   ![the Feature tab in Settings for the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](./hololens2-images/feature_enable_preview_releases.png)

1. Click the **Ok** button to return to the starting page.

1. Click the **Start** button to begin discovering feature packages.

1. Point the Mixed Reality Feature Tool to your Unity project.  To do this, click the **Browse for the project folder** (**...**) button to the right of the **Project Path** field:

   ![Select the Unity project in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](./hololens2-images/feature_tool_select_unity_project.png)

1. In the file selection dialog, select your Unity project folder, and then click the **Open** button.

1. In the **Select project** dialog, click the **Discover Features** button.

1. In the **Discover Features** page, expand the **Other features** section, and then select the **Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView** checkbox:

   ![The Discover Features pane in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](./hololens2-images/mrtk_webview2_selected.png)

   This marks the WebView plugin for Unity for installation. In the **Version** dropdown list, by default, the latest version of the plugin is selected.

1. Click the **Get Features** button.  This downloads the required packages.

1. Once the packages are downloaded, click the **Import** button:

   ![The Import Features pane in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](./hololens2-images/feature_tool_import_features.png)

1. On the **Review and Approve** page, inspect the modifications that will be made to your project `manifest.json` file, and inspect the list of files (such as `.tgz` packages) that will be copied into your project:

   ![The Review and Approve pane in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](./hololens2-images/feature_tool_review.png)

1. Click the **Approve** button to finalize the changes.

1. In your Unity project, in your project's **Assets** folder, inspect the WebView prefab.

The Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity is now installed and imported.  Continue with the next Step below.

For more information, see [Welcome to the Mixed Reality Feature Tool](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 5 - Set up the WebView prefab in Unity scene

Now that the WebView plugin for Unity is installed and imported, set up the WebView prefab in your Unity scene, as follows:

1. In the Unity Editor, navigate to the **Project** window, and then find the WebView prefab by going to **Packages** > **Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView (Preview)** > **Runtime** > **Prefab**.

1. Drag the WebView prefab into your scene.

1. With the WebView prefab selected in the **Hierarchy** window, move it to a suitable starting location within the scene (such as under the `MixedRealitySceneContent` node), making sure it's in view of the default camera.

1. In the **Inspector** window, you can change the initial URL that's loaded by the WebView prefab. To do this, locate the **Current URL** text box, and then enter the desired URL. By default, the prefab loads `https://www.microsoft.com`:

   ![The Current URL input field for WebView prefab in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_inspector_change_url.png)


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 6 - Test the project

Now that you've added the WebView plugin to the scene, it's a good time to test your project.

1. To test the project directly in the Unity editor, click the **Play** button:

   ![Starting editor play mode](./hololens2-images/unity-playmode-testing.png)

1. To test the project on the actual device, follow the steps in [Build and deploy to the HoloLens](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/build-and-deploy-to-hololens).

Then continue with the next steps below.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 7 - Extending WebView2 functionality

Although the prefab exposes just a single property, there's additional functionality exposed on the `WebView` script. Let's take a look at exposing some of this functionality in our project.  First, inspect the `WebView` script to get an idea of what's available.  

> [!TIP]
> To view the contents of a script in your default code editor, double-click the name of the script in the **Inspector** window.

Now that you've reviewed the `WebView` code, let's extend the functionality of the sample. In the rest of this step, we'll add some basic functionality so that the user will have a **Back** button, a **Go** button, and a text field to navigate to a custom URL.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Add the input field and buttons

1. Modify the scene hierarchy as follows:
   1. Under `MixedRealitySceneContent`, add a new input component (right-click > **UI** > **Input Field - TextMeshPro**). This automatically adds a parent `Canvas` for the component.
   1. Under the new `Canvas`, add **two** new `Button` components (right-click > **UI** > **Button - TextMeshPro**).
   1. Reorder the `WebView` component to make it a child of the `Canvas` component:

   ![Updated scene hierarchy with new components in Unity](./hololens2-images/unity_scene_hierarchy.png)

1. Update the Canvas properties by selecting the Canvas in the **Hierarchy** pane, then making the following changes in the **Inspector** pane:
   1. Change **Width** and **Height** to 600, 400 respectively.
   1. Change **Scale** for **X**, **Y**, and **Z** to 0.001, 0.001, 0.001:

   ![Updated Canvas properties in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_canvas_inspector.png)

1. Update the input field's properties by selecting it in the **Hierarchy** pane, then making the following changes in the **Inspector** pane:
   1. Change **Name** to "AddressField (TMP)"
   1. Change **Pos X**, **Pos Y**, **Pos Z** to -2, 178, -5, respectively.
   1. Change **Width** and **Height** to 390, 30 respectively:

   ![Updated Input Field properties in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_addresswell_inspector.png)

1. Update the first button's properties by selecting it in the **Hierarchy** pane, then making the following changes in the **Inspector** pane:
   1. Change **Name** to "Back Button"
   1. Change **Pos X**, **Pos Y**, **Pos Z** to -248, 178, -5, respectively.
   1. Change **Width** and **Height** to 75, 30 respectively:

   ![Updated Back Button properties in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_backbutton_inspector.png)

1. Update the second button's properties by selecting it in the **Hierarchy** pane, then making the following changes in the **Inspector** pane:
   1. Change **Name** to "Go Button"
   1. Change **Pos X**, **Pos Y**, **Pos Z** to 242, 178, -5, respectively.
   1. Change **Width** and **Height** to 75, 30 respectively:

   ![Updated Go Button properties in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_gobutton_inspector.png)

1. Update the WebView's properties by selecting it in the **Hierarchy** pane, then making the following changes in the **Inspector** pane:
   1. Change **Position** > **X**, **Y**, **Z** to 0, -16, -5, respectively.
   1. Change **Scale** > **X**, **Y**, **Z** to 570, 340, 1 respectively:

   ![Updated WebView properties in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_webview_transform_inspector.png)

1. Add a background image to the **Canvas**:
   1. Select the Canvas in the **Hierarchy** pane.
   1. Click the **Add Component** button at the bottom of the **Inspector** pane.
   1. Type **Image** and then select the top result in the list.
   1. Click the **Color** well for the image and then choose a background color. In our example, we chose a gray color. (This is simply to show some contrast between the different controls in the canvas.)

   ![Set the background color of the Canvas in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_canvasimage_inspector.png)

1. In the **Hierarchy** pane, under **Back Button**, select **Text (TMP)**.  Then in the **Inspector** pane, change the **Text Input** to **Back**:

   ![Change button's text to 'Back' in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_backbutton_text.png)

1. Repeat the above process for the **Go Button**, substituting **Go** as the text.

   You should now have a scene which looks similar to the following:

   ![The current scene in Unity's Scene view](./hololens2-images/unity_completed_scene.png)


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
#### Add code to hook up the buttons

Now that we have our UI designed, we will now create the code to hook up the buttons.  To do that, we'll create a new script that derives from `Microsoft.MixedReality.WebView`.

1. In the **Inspector** window for WebView, click **Add Component**, select **New script**, type **WebViewBrowser**, and then click **Create and add**. Your new component is added to the **Inspector** window.

1. In the **Inspector** window, double-click the `WebViewBrowser` script, to edit the script.

1. Replace the contents of that file with the following code:

   ```C#
   using Microsoft.MixedReality.WebView;
   using UnityEngine.UI;
   using UnityEngine;
   using TMPro;
   using System;

   public class WebViewBrowser : MonoBehaviour
   {
      // Declare UI elements: Back button, Go button, and URL input field
      public Button BackButton;
      public Button GoButton;
      public TMP_InputField URLField;

      private void Start()
      {
         // Get the WebView component attached to the game object
         var webViewComponent = gameObject.GetComponent<WebView>();
         webViewComponent.GetWebViewWhenReady((IWebView webView) =>
         {
               // If the WebView supports browser history, enable the Back button
               if (webView is IWithBrowserHistory history)
               {
                  // Add an event listener for the Back button to navigate back in history
                  BackButton.onClick.AddListener(() => history.GoBack());

                  // Update the Back button's enabled state based on whether there's any history to go back to
                  history.CanGoBackUpdated += CanGoBack;
               }

               // Add an event listener for the Go button to load the URL that was entered in the input field
               GoButton.onClick.AddListener(() => webView.Load(new Uri(URLField.text)));

               // Subscribe to the Navigated event to update the URL input field whenever a navigation occurs
               webView.Navigated += OnNavigated;

               // Set the initial value of the URL input field to the current URL of the WebView
               if (webView.Page != null)
               {
                  URLField.text = webView.Page.AbsoluteUri;
               }
         });
      }

      // Update the URL input field with the new path after navigation
      private void OnNavigated(string path)
      {
         URLField.text = path;
      }

      // Enable or disable the Back button based on whether there's any history to go back to
      private void CanGoBack(bool value)
      {
         BackButton.enabled = value;
      }
   }
   ```

1. Connect the UI `GameObjects` to the `WebViewBrowser` code that we just wrote:
   1. Select the **WebViewBrowser**.
   1. Drag **Back Button** from the Hierarchy pane into the **Back Button** variable field for the WebView Browser in the Inspector.
   1. Drag **Go Button** from the Hierarchy pane into the **Go Button** variable field for the WebView Browser in the Inspector:

   ![The WebView Browser Prefab with assigned variables in Unity's Inspector](./hololens2-images/unity_webview_connect_prefabs.png)

1. You can now test the scene in the Unity Editor. With everything wired up in your scene, you should be able to verify that everything is working as expected. Try testing out the scene by entering a new URL into the `AddressField` text box (must be a full URL including the protocol), then pressing the **Go** button. Make sure the **Back** button works as well.

   It can sometimes be helpful to debug your application running on your HoloLens, and the steps to do so are slightly different than standard debugging within Visual Studio.  For more information on how to set up and connect to your application running on the HoloLens or inside of the Unity editor, see [Managed debugging with Unity](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/managed-debugging-with-unity-il2cpp).

Continue with the next steps below.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Step 8 - Learn about WebView2 events and interactions in Unity

The Microsoft Mixed Reality WebView plugin for Unity provides events for working with the webview. 

One important event is `IWithPostMessage.MessageReceived`, which is raised when a message is sent from the webview to the Unity app. The `MessageReceived` event is defined in the `Microsoft.MixedReality.WebView.IWithPostMessage` interface. 

`IWithPostMessage` also defines the `PostMessage()` method, which can be used to send a message from the Unity app to the webview.

Here is an example of how to use these events and methods for working with the webview:

```C#
using Microsoft.MixedReality.WebView;

public class WebViewExample : MonoBehaviour, IWithPostMessage
{
    private void Start()
    {
        var webViewComponent = gameObject.GetComponent<WebView>();

        if (Url != string.Empty)
        {
            Debug.Log("Loading URL: " + Url);
            webViewComponent.Load(new Uri(Url));
        }

        webViewComponent.GetWebViewWhenReady((IWebView webView) =>
        {
            // Add event listeners for WebView2 events
            ((IWithPostMessage)webView).MessageReceived += OnMessageReceived;
        });
    }

    // Handler for WebView2 OnPostMessage event
    void OnMessageReceived(string message)
    {
        Debug.Log("WebView2 message received: " + message);
    }
}
```
