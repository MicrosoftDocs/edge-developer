# Introduction to Microsoft Edge WebView2 (Preview)  

The Microsoft Edge WebView2 control enables you to embed web technologies \(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\) in your native applications.  The WebView2 control uses [Microsoft Edge (Chromium)][MicrosoftedgeinsiderMain] as the rendering engine to display the web content in native applications.  With WebView2, you may embed web code in different parts of your native application, or build the entire native application within a single WebView.  For information on how to start building a WebView2 application, see [Get Started](#getting-started).

> [!NOTE]
> The WebView2 Preview is intended for early prototyping and to gather feedback to help shape the API.  You should not use the preview in your production apps because there may be breaking changes.  For more information, see [Webview2Releasenotes].  

## Hybrid application approach  

Developers often have to decide between building a web application or a native application.  The decision hinges on the trade-off between reach and power.  Web applications allow for a broad reach.  As a Web developer, you may reuse most, if not all of your code, across all different platforms.  Native applications, however, utilize the capabilities of the entire native platform.

:::image-end:::  

Hybrid applications allow developers to enjoy the best of both worlds.  Hybrid application developers benefit from the ubiquity and strength of the web platform, and the power and full capabilities of the native platform.

## Getting started  

To build and test your application using the WebView2 control, you need to have both [Microsoft Edge (Chromium)][MicrosoftedgeinsiderDownload] and the [WebView2 SDK][NugetPackagesMicrosoftWebWebView2] installed.  Select one of the following options to get started.  

*   [Getting Started with Win32 C/C++][Webview2GettingstartedWin32]  
*   [Getting Started with WPF][Webview2GettingstartedWpf]  
*   [Getting Started with WinForms][Webview2GettingstartedWinforms]  
*   [Getting Started with WinUI3][Webview2GettingstartedWinui]  

The [WebView2 Samples][GithubMicrosoftedgeWebview2samples] repository contains samples that demonstrate all of the WebView2 SDK features and API usage patterns.  As more features are added to the WebView2 SDK, the sample applications will be updated.  

## Supported platforms  

A developer preview is available on the following programming environments.  

*   Win32 C/C++  
*   .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later  
*   .NET Core 3.0 or later  
*   [WinUI 3.0][UwpToolkitsWinui3]  

You are able to run WebView2 applications on the following versions of Windows.  

*   Windows 10  
*   Windows 8.1  
*   Windows 8  
*   Windows 7  
*   Windows Server 2016  
*   Windows Server 2012  
*   Windows Server 2012R2  
*   Windows Server 2008 R2
