## WebView2 Runtime and Installer  

[Evergreen distribution model][ConceptDistributionEvergreenModel] allows you to target or chain install the WebView2 Runtime onto your user's machine.  A preview of the WebView2 Runtime and installer is expected to be available Q3 2020 and GA in Q4 2020.  

## Fixed version  

[Fixed version distribution model][ConceptsDistributionFixedVersionModel] allows you to package the Microsoft Edge binaries inside your native application.  Engineering work is currently under way with a preview anticipated to be ready towards the end of Q3 2020 and GA Q4 2020.  

## General availability  

### Win32 C/C++  

The Win32 C/C++ SDK is expected to GA in Q4 2020, shortly after the WebView2 Runtime and installer GA.  

### .NET  

The .NET SDK wraps the Win32 C/C++ SDK.  The .NET SDK is expected to GA shortly after the Win32 C/C++ GA in Q4 2020.  

### WinUI 3.0  

You are able to access WebView2 in your UWP applications using [Win UI 3.0][UwpToolkitsWinui3Index], currently in alpha.  For more information about keeping up to date, see [Windows UI Library Roadmap][GithubMicrosoftUiXamlRoadmap].
