#### Cancel 

The host may set this flag to cancel the navigation.

> public bool [Cancel](#cancel)

If set, it will be as if the navigation never happened and the current page's content will be intact. For performance reasons, GET HTTP requests may happen, while the host is responding. This means cookies can be set and used part of a request for the navigation.

#### IsRedirected 

True when the navigation is redirected.

> public bool [IsRedirected](#isredirected)

#### IsUserInitiated 

True when the navigation was initiated through a user gesture as opposed to programmatic navigation.

> public bool [IsUserInitiated](#isuserinitiated)

#### NavigationId 

The ID of the navigation.

> public ulong [NavigationId](#navigationid)

#### RequestHeaders 

The HTTP request headers for the navigation.

> public HttpRequestHeaders [RequestHeaders](#requestheaders)

Note, you cannot modify the HTTP request headers in a NavigationStarting event.

#### Uri 

The uri of the requested navigation.

> public string [Uri](#uri)
