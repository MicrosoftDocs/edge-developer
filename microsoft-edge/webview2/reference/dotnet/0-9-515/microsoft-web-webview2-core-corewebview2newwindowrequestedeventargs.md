## Members

#### Handled 

Whether the NewWindowRequestedEvent is handled by host.

> public bool [Handled](#handled)

If this is false and no NewWindow is set, the WebView will open a popup window and it will be returned as opened WindowProxy. If set to true and no NewWindow is set for a window.open call, the opened WindowProxy will be for an dummy window object and no window will load. Default is false.

#### IsUserInitiated 

IsUserInitiated is true when the new window request was initiated through a user gesture such as clicking an anchor tag with target.

> public bool [IsUserInitiated](#isuserinitiated)

#### NewWindow 

Gets the new window.

> public CoreWebView2 [NewWindow](#newwindow)

#### Uri 

The target uri of the NewWindowRequest.

> public string [Uri](#uri)

The target webview should not be navigated. If the NewWindow is set, its top level window will return as the opened WindowProxy.

#### GetDeferral 

Obtain a CoreWebView2Deferral object and put the event into a deferred state.

> public CoreWebView2Deferral [GetDeferral](#getdeferral)()

You can use the CoreWebView2Deferral object to complete the window open request at a later time. While this event is deferred the opener window will be returned a WindowProxy to an unnavigated window, which will navigate when the deferral is complete.
