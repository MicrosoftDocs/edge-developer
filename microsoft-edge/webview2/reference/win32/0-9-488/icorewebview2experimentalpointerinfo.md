It takes fields from all three and excludes some win32 specific data types like HWND and HANDLE. Note, sourceDevice is taken out but we expect the PointerDeviceRect and DisplayRect to cover the existing use cases of sourceDevice. Another big difference is that any of the point or rect locations are expected to be in webview physical coordinates. That is, coordinates relative to the webview and no DPI scaling applied.
