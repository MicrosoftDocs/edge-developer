## Members

#### get_Handled 

Gets whether the NewWindowRequestedEvent is handled by host.

> public HRESULT [get_Handled](#get_handled)(BOOL * handled)

#### get_IsUserInitiated 

IsUserInitiated is true when the new window request was initiated through a user gesture such as clicking an anchor tag with target.

> public HRESULT [get_IsUserInitiated](#get_isuserinitiated)(BOOL * isUserInitiated)

#### get_NewWindow 

Gets the new window.

> public HRESULT [get_NewWindow](#get_newwindow)([ICoreWebView2](icorewebview2.md) ** newWindow)

#### get_Uri 

The target uri of the NewWindowRequest.

> public HRESULT [get_Uri](#get_uri)(LPWSTR * uri)

#### GetDeferral 

Obtain an [ICoreWebView2Deferral](icorewebview2deferral.md) object and put the event into a deferred state.

> public HRESULT [GetDeferral](#getdeferral)([ICoreWebView2Deferral](icorewebview2deferral.md) ** deferral)

You can use the [ICoreWebView2Deferral](icorewebview2deferral.md) object to complete the window open request at a later time. While this event is deferred the opener window will be returned a WindowProxy to an unnavigated window, which will navigate when the deferral is complete.

#### put_Handled 

Sets whether the NewWindowRequestedEvent is handled by host.

> public HRESULT [put_Handled](#put_handled)(BOOL handled)

If this is false and no NewWindow is set, the WebView will open a popup window and it will be returned as opened WindowProxy. If set to true and no NewWindow is set for a window.open call, the opened WindowProxy will be for an dummy window object and no window will load. Default is false.

#### put_NewWindow 

Sets a WebView as a result of the NewWindowRequest.

> public HRESULT [put_NewWindow](#put_newwindow)([ICoreWebView2](icorewebview2.md) * newWindow)

The target webview should not be navigated. If the NewWindow is set, its top level window will return as the opened WindowProxy.
