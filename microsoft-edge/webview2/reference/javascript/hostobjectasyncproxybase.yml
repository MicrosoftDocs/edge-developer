summary: >-
  An asynchronous host object proxy. Host objects added via `CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript` are exposed as host
  object proxies using `window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.{name}`<!-- -->. Host object proxies are promises and resolve
  to an object representing the host object. The promise is rejected if the app has not added an object with the name.
  When JavaScript code access a property or method of the object, a promise is returned, which resolves to the value
  returned from the host for the property or method, or rejected in case of error, for example, no property or method on
  the object or parameters are not valid.


  Host object proxies are JavaScript Proxy objects that intercept all property get, property set, and method
  invocations. Properties or methods that are a part of the Function or Object prototype are run locally. Additionally
  any property or method in the `chrome.webview.hostObjects.options.forceLocalProperties` array are also run locally.
  This defaults to including optional methods that have meaning in JavaScript like `toJSON` and `Symbol.toPrimitive`<!--
  -->. Add more to the array as required.

      on the proxy object. But proxy.applyHostFunction('toString') runs toString on the host proxied object instead.
