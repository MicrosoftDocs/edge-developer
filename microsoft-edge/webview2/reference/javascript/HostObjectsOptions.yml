    summary: >-
      When calling a method on a synchronous proxy, the result should also be a synchronous proxy. But in some cases,
      the sync or async context is lost (for example, when providing to native code a reference to a function, and then
      calling that function in native code). In these cases, the proxy will be asynchronous if this option is `false`
      and synchronous if this option is `true`<!-- -->.

    summary: >-
      This is an array of regular expressions. When calling a method on a synchronous proxy, the method call will be
      performed asynchronously if the method name matches a string or regular expression in this array. Setting this
      value to `/Async$/` will make any method that ends with Async be an asynchronous method call. If an async method
      doesn't match here and isn't forced to be asynchronous, the method will be invoked synchronously, blocking
      execution of the calling JavaScript and then returning the resolution of the promise, rather than returning a
      promise.


      This defaults to `[]`<!-- -->.

    summary: >-
      This is an array of host object property names that will be run locally, instead of being called on the native
      host object. This defaults to `['then', 'toJSON', Symbol.toString, Symbol.toPrimitive]`<!-- -->. You can add other
      properties to specify that they should be run locally on the javascript host object proxy.

    fullName: ignoreMemberNotFoundError
    summary: >-
      By default, an exception is thrown when attempting to get the value of a proxy property that doesn't exist on the
      corresponding native class. Setting this property to `true` changes the behavior to match Chakra WinRT projection
      (and general JavaScript) behavior of returning `undefined` with no error.

      This is a callback delegate that will be called with debug information if non-null.


      For example, you can set this to `console.log.bind(console)` to have it print debug information to the console to
      help when troubleshooting host object usage.

    uid: 'WebView2Script!HostObjectsOptions#shouldSerializeDates:member'
    fullName: shouldSerializeDates
    summary: >-
      By default this is `false`<!-- -->, and javascript `Date` objects will be sent to host objects as a string using
      `JSON.stringify`<!-- -->.


      You can set this property to `true` to have `Date` objects properly serialize as a `VT_DATE` when sending to the
      native host object, and have `VT_DATE` properties and return values create a JavaScript `Date` object.
