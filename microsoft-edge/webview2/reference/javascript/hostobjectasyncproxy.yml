summary: >-
  An asynchronous host object proxy. Host objects added via `CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript` are exposed as host
  object proxies using `window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.{name}`<!-- -->. Host object proxies are promises and resolve
  to an object representing the host object. The promise is rejected if the app has not added an object with the name.
  When JavaScript code access a property or method of the object, a promise is returned. The promise resolves to the
  value that's returned from the host for the property or method. The promise is rejected in case of error; for example,
  no property or method on the object or parameters are not valid.


  Host object proxies are JavaScript Proxy objects that intercept all property `get`<!-- -->, property `set`<!-- -->,
  and method invocations. Properties or methods that are a part of the `Function` or `Object` prototype are run in the
  JavaScript engine of the current document. Additionally any property or method in the
  `chrome.webview.hostObjects.options.forceLocalProperties` array are also run in the JavaScript engine of the current
  document. This defaults to including optional methods that have meaning in JavaScript like `toJSON` and
  `Symbol.toPrimitive`<!-- -->. Add more to the array as required.

    summary: >-
      A method which returns a promise for a synchronous host object proxy for the same host object. For example,
      `chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample.methodCall()` returns an asynchronous host object proxy. Use the `sync` method
      to obtain a synchronous host object proxy instead: `const syncProxy = await
      chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample.methodCall().sync()`<!-- -->.
