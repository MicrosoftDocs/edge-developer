# Distribution of apps using WebView2  

When distributing your WebView2 app, make sure the backing web platform, the [WebView2 Runtime][Webview2Installer], is present before the app starts.  This article describes how you can install the WebView2 Runtime, and use the two distribution modes for your WebView2 app:  [Evergreen](#evergreen-distribution-mode) and [Fixed Version](#fixed-version-distribution-mode).  

## Evergreen distribution mode  

> [!NOTE]
> The Evergreen distribution mode is recommended for most developers.  

The Evergreen distribution mode ensures that your app is taking advantage of the latest features and security updates.  It has the following characteristics.  

*   The underlying web platform \(WebView2 Runtime\) updates automatically without additional effort from you.  
*   All apps that use the Evergreen distribution mode use a shared copy of the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime, which saves disk space.  
    
### Understanding the WebView2 Runtime  

The WebView2 Runtime is a redistributable runtime and serves as the backing web platform for WebView2 apps.  The concept is similar to Visual C++ or the .NET Runtime for C++/.NET apps.  The Runtime contains modified Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) binaries that are fine-tuned and tested for apps.  The Runtime does not appear as a user-visible browser upon installation.  For example, a user does not have a browser desktop shortcut or start menu entry.  

During development and testing, you may use either as the backing web platform.  

*   The WebView2 Runtime  
*   Any Insider \(non-stable\) Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) browser channel  

In production environments, you must ensure the Runtime is present on user devices before the app starts.  The Microsoft Edge Stable channel is unavailable for WebView2 usage.  The decision prevents apps from taking a dependency on the browser in production.

Do not take a dependency on the browser because:  

*   Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) isn't guaranteed to be present on all user devices.  For example, devices disconnected from Windows Update or not managed by Microsoft directly \(a large portion of the Enterprise and EDU market\) may not have the browser.  Allowing you to distribute the WebView2 Runtime avoids taking a dependency on the browser as a pre-requisite for apps.  
*   Browsers and apps have different use cases, and so taking a dependency on a browser may have unintended side-effects on your apps.  For example, IT admins may version-control the browser for internal website compatibility.  The WebView2 Runtime allows apps to stay evergreen while browser updates are being actively managed.  
*   As opposed to the browser, the Runtime is developed and tested for app scenarios and in some cases may include bug fixes not yet available in the browser.  
    
In the future, the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime will ship in future releases of Windows.  Deploy the Runtime with your production app until the Runtime becomes more universally available.  

### Deploying the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime  

Only one installation of the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime is needed for all Evergreen apps on the device.  There are a number of tools available on the [WebView2 Runtime download page][Webview2Installer].  The following tools help you deploy the Evergreen Runtime.  

*   WebView2 Runtime Bootstrapper is a tiny \(approximately 2 MB\) installer.  WebView2 Runtime Bootstrapper downloads and installs the Evergreen Runtime from Microsoft servers that matches the user's device architecture.  
*   Use a link to programmatically download the bootstrapper.  
*   WebView2 Runtime Standalone Installer is a full installer that can install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime in offline environments.  
    
Currently, both the bootstrapper and standalone installer only support per-machine installs, which requires elevation.  If an installer is run without elevation, the user is prompted to elevate permissions.  

We recommend the following workflows to ensure the Runtime is already installed before your app launches.  You may adjust your workflow depending on your scenario.  Sample code is available in the [Samples repo][InstallerSample].  

#### Online-only deployment  

If you have an online-only deployment scenario where end users are assumed to have internet access, complete the following steps.  

1.  During your app setup, ensure the Runtime is already installed.  To  verify, complete one of the following actions.  
    *   Inspect if the `pv (REG_SZ)` regkey exists and is not `null` or empty.  Find  `pv (REG_SZ)` at the following location.  
        
    On 64-bit Windows,

        ```text
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}
        ```

    On 32-bit Windows,
    
        ```text
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}
        ```

    *   Run [GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString][ReferenceWin32Webview2IdlGetavailablecorewebview2browserversionstring] and ensure the `versionInfo` is `NULL`.  
1.  If the Runtime isn't installed, use the link to programmatically download the bootstrapper.  
1.  Invoke the bootstrapper from an elevated process or command prompt with `MicrosoftEdgeWebview2Setup.exe /silent /install` for silent install.  
    
The previous workflow has the following benefits.  

*   Install the Runtime only when needed or when you're not required to package installers.  
*   The bootstrapper automatically detects device architecture and installs the matching Runtime. 
*   Install the Runtime silently.  
    
You may also choose to package the bootstrapper with your app instead of programmatically downloading it on demand.  

#### Offline deployment  

If you have an offline deployment scenario where app deployment has to work entirely offline, complete the following steps.  

1.  Download the [standalone installer][Webview2Installer].  
1.  Include the installer in your app installer or updater.  
1.  During your app setup, ensure the Runtime is already installed.  To  verify, complete one of the following actions.  
    *   Inspect if the `pv (REG_SZ)` regkey exists and is not `null` or empty.  Find  `pv (REG_SZ)` at the following location.  

    On 64-bit Windows,

        ```text
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}
        ```

    On 32-bit Windows,

        ```text
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}
        ```
          
    *   Run [GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString][ReferenceWin32Webview2IdlGetavailablecorewebview2browserversionstring] and ensure the `versionInfo` is `NULL`.  
1.  If the Runtime isn't installed, run the standalone installer.  If you want to run a silent installation, either run the installer from an elevated process or copy and run the following command.  
    
    ```shell
    MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstaller{X64/X86/ARM64}.exe /silent /install
    ```  
    
### Stay compatible in Evergreen mode

The Web is constantly evolving. The Evergreen WebView2 Runtime is kept up-to-date to provide you with the latest features and security fixes.  To ensure your app stays compatible with the web, we recommend you set up testing infrastructure.

Non-stable Microsoft Edge channels \(Beta/Dev/Canary\) provide a sneak peek into what is coming next into WebView2 Runtime.  Just like developing websites for Microsoft Edge, we recommend that you test your WebView2 app regularly.  Test your WebView2 app against one of the non-stable channels, and update your app or [report issues][GithubMicrosoftedgeWebviewfeedback] if issues arise. Typically Dev and Beta are the recommended channels.  To help you decide which channel is right, navigate to [Overview of the Microsoft Edge channels][DeployEdgeMicrosoftEdgeChannels].  You can download the [non-stable Microsoft Edge channel][DownloadNonstableEdge] on your test environment, and use `regkey` or environment variables to indicate the channel preference for your testing app.  For more information, navigate to [CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions][ReferenceWin32Webview2IdlCreatecorewebview2environmentwithoptions].  You may also use [WebDriver][HowtoWebdriver] to automate WebView2 testing.

## Fixed Version distribution mode  

> [!NOTE]
> The Fixed Version distribution mode is in Public Preview.  

The Fixed Version distribution mode was previously named bring-your-own.  

For constrained environments with strict compatibility requirements, consider using the Fixed Version distribution mode.  Select and package a specific version of the WebView2 Runtime using the Fixed Version distribution mode.  You may specify the timing of Runtime updates for your app.  The Fixed Version distribution mode doesn't receive any automatic updates. You should plan to update your app and the Runtime.  

To use the Fixed Version mode,  

*   [Download][Webview2Installer] the Fixed Version package, and decompress the package.  
*   Include the decompressed Fixed Version binaries in your project.  
*   Indicate the path to the Fixed Version binaries when creating the WebView2 environment.  
    *   For Win32 C/C++, you may create the environment using the [CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions][ReferenceWin32Webview2IdlCreatecorewebview2environmentwithoptions] function.  Use the `browserExecutableFolder` parameter to indicate the path to the Fixed Version binaries.  
    *   For .NET, you may do either of the following options to specify the environment.  
        
        > [!NOTE]
        > You must specify the environment before the WebView2 `Source` property takes effect.  
        
        *   Set the `CreationProperties` \([WPF][ReferenceWpfMicrosoftWebWebview2WpfWebview2Creationproperties]/[WinForms][ReferenceWinFormsMicrosoftWebWebview2WinFormsWebview2]\) property on the WebView2 element.  Use the `BrowserExecutableFolder` member in the `CoreWebView2CreationProperties` \([WPF][ReferenceWpfMicrosoftWebWebview2WpfCorewebview2creationpropertiesCorewebview2creationproperties]/[WinForms][ReferenceWinFormsMicrosoftWebWebview2WinForms]\) class to indicate the path to the Fixed Version binaries.  
        *   Use `EnsureCoreWebView2Async` \([WPF][ReferenceWpfMicrosoftWebWebview2WpfWebview2Ensurecorewebview2async]/[WinForms][ReferenceWinformsMicrosoftWebWebview2WinformsWebview2Ensurecorewebview2async]\) to specify the environment.  Use the `browserExecutableFolder` parameter in [CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync][ReferenceDotnetMicrosoftWebWebview2CoreCorewebview2environmentCreateasync] to indicate the path to the Fixed Version binaries.  
*   Package and ship the Fixed Version binaries with your app.  Update the binaries as appropriate.
