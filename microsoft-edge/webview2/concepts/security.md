# Best practices for developing secure WebView2 applications

The [WebView2 control](aka.ms/webview2) allows developers to host web content in their native applications. When used correctly, hosting web content offers several advantages, such as using web-based UI, accessing features of the web platform, sharing code cross-platform, and so on. To avoid vulnerabilities that can arise from hosting web content, make sure to design your WebView2 application to closely monitor interactions between the web content and the host application. 

1. Treat all web content as insecure
    - Validate web messages and host object parameters before consuming them, because web messages and parameters can be malformed (unintentionally or maliciously) and cause the app to behave unexpectedly.
    - Always check the origin of the document running inside WebView2 and assess the trustworthiness of the content. 

2. Design specific web messages and host object interactions instead of using generic proxies.

3. Restrict web content functionality by modifying [ICoreWebView2Settings](../reference/win32/0-9-538/icorewebview2settings) (Win32) or [CoreWebView2Settings](../reference/dotnet/0-9-538/microsoft-web-webview2-core-corewebview2settings) (.NET) as follows:
    - Set `AreHostObjectsAllowed` to `false`, if you don’t expect the web content to access host objects.
    - Set `IsWebMessageEnabled` to `false`, if you don’t expect the web content to post web messages to your native application. 
    - Set `IsScriptEnabled` to `false`, if you don’t expect the web content to run scripts (for example, when showing static html content).
    - Set `AreDefaultScriptDialogsEnabled` to `false`, if you don’t expect the web content to show `alert` or `prompt` dialog boxes.

4.	Use the `NavigationStarting` and `FrameNavigationStarting` events to update settings based on the origin of the new page as follows:
    1.	To prevent your application from navigating to certain pages, use these events to check and then block page or frame navigation. 
    2.	When navigating to a new page, you may need to adjust the property values on [ICoreWebView2Settings](../reference/win32/0-9-538/icorewebview2settings) (Win32) or [CoreWebView2Settings](../reference/dotnet/0-9-538/microsoft-web-webview2-core-corewebview2settings) (.NET)` as described above.

5. When navigating to a new document, use the `ContentLoading` event to remove exposed host objects using `RemoveHostObjectFromScript`.
