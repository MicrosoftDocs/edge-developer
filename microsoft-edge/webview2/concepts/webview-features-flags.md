# WebView2 browser flags

One of the ways you can interact with Microsoft Edge WebView2 and impact behavior is by passing browser flags (arguments, or switches) to WebView2.  These browser flags are useful for testing forthcoming features, and for diagnosing issues.  

> [!WARNING]
> Apps in production shouldn't use WebView2 browser flags, because these flags might be removed or altered at any time, and aren't necessarily supported long-term.

Generally, the flags are owned by both Chromium and Microsoft Edge.  Chromium flags are not owned or controlled by Microsoft Edge, so Microsoft Edge doesn't have control over when or how the flags are removed or altered in their behavior.

You can set browser flags in your local device environment, or set browser flags programmatically through code.  Both approaches are described below.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Setting browser flags in your local device environment

To test forthcoming features or to diagnose issues, we recommend using browser flags in your local device environment, via setting the `WEBVIEW2_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` environment variable or via registry keys.  For more information, see the following Win32 API Reference: [CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/webview2-idl#createcorewebview2environmentwithoptions).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Setting browser flags programmatically through code

Instead of setting browser flags in your local device environment, an alternative approach is to set browser flags programmatically, by passing the browser flags as the `AdditionalBrowserArguments` property of `CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions`.  If you set browser flags programmatically, be sure to remove the flags in code before shipping your app, to avoid accidentally shipping the flags in production.

##### [.NET/C#](#tab/dotnetcsharp)

* `CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions` Class:
   * [CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions.AdditionalBrowserArguments Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2environmentoptions.additionalbrowserarguments)

##### [WinRT/C#](#tab/winrtcsharp)

* `CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions` Class:
   * [CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions.AdditionalBrowserArguments Property](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/winrt/microsoft_web_webview2_core/corewebview2environmentoptions#additionalbrowserarguments)

##### [Win32/C++](#tab/win32cpp)

* `ICoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions`:
   * [ICoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions::get_AdditionalBrowserArguments](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2environmentoptions#get_additionalbrowserarguments)
   * [ICoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions::put_AdditionalBrowserArguments](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2environmentoptions#put_additionalbrowserarguments)

## Available WebView2 browser flags

The following are some of the flags we've seen used.

| Feature | Details |
|:--- |:--- |
| `accept-lang` | Specifies `Accept-Language` to send to servers and expose to JavaScript via the [Navigator.language](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language) DOM property.  The format is `language[-country]`, where `language` is the 2-letter code from ISO-639. |
| `allow-file-access-from-files` | Allows reading `file://` URIs from other `file://` URIs. |
| `allow-insecure-localhost` | Enables TLS/SSL errors on localhost to be ignored, so that no interstitial is done and no blocking of requests is done. |
| `allow-run-as-system` |  By default, the Edge WebView browser exits if launched as System (launching as System is not recommended).  This flag bypasses that check, so that even if the Edge WebView browser is launched as System, the Edge WebView browser doesn't exit. |
| `allow-running-insecure-content` | Enables insecure content in Cast Web Runtime.  This flag unblocks MSPs that serve content from HTTP sources. |
| `auto-open-devtools-for-tabs` | Makes Edge WebView auto-open the DevTools window for each tab.  For use by developers and by automation. |
| `autoplay-policy` | Command-line flag name to set the autoplay policy. |
| `block-new-web-contents` | If `true`, all pop-ups and calls to `window.open` fail. |
| `disable-background-timer-throttling` | Disables task throttling of timer tasks from background pages. |
| `disable-domain-action-user-agent-override` | Disables the per-domain User Agent override from the Domain Actions feature. |
| `disable-gpu` | Disables GPU hardware acceleration.  If a software renderer isn't in place, the GPU process doesn't launch. |
| `disable-gpu-driver-bug-workarounds` | Disables workarounds for various GPU driver bugs. |
| `disable-site-isolation-trials` | Disables site isolation. |
| `disable-web-security` | Disables cross-origin policy and doesn't enforce the same-origin policy.  Use for website testing only. |
| `disk-cache-size` | Forces the maximum disk space to be used by the disk cache, in bytes. |
| `do-not-de-elevate` | Prevents de-elevation of the WebView2 on launch.  Used after de-elevating, to prevent infinite loops. |
| `edge-webview-debugging-script` | Runs `PostWebMessage` script asynchronously. |
| `edge-webview-foreground-boost-opt-in` | Opts-in to foreground boost. |
| `edge-webview-foreground-boost-opt-out` | Opts-out of foreground boost. |
| `edge-webview-force-personal-context` | Forces Edge WebView browser processes to run in WIP personal context. |
| `edge-webview-interactive-dragging` | Enables interactive dragging. |
| `edge-webview-is-background` | Indicates that WebView is being launched in the background. |
| `edge-webview-no-dpi-workaround` | Disables the "DPI awareness app compatibility shim" workaround, which launches Edge WebView browser process via a shell, so that the process doesn't inherit the "app compat" shim. |
| `edge-webview-run-with-package-id` | Runs WebView processes with a package identity (package ID) for a bridged Desktop app. |
| `edge-webview-run-without-package-id` | Runs WebView processes without a package identity (package ID) for a bridged Desktop app. |
| `embedded-browser-webview-dpi-awareness` | Sets the DPI awareness level of the server-side processes. |
| `enable-experimental-web-platform-features` | Enables Web Platform features that are in development. |
| `enable-logging` | Enable logging at the error level. |
| `force-color-profile` | Force all monitors to be treated as though they have the specified color profile.  Valid values: `srgb`, `generic-rgb`. |
| `force-device-scale-factor` | Overrides the device scale factor for the Edge WebView browser UI and the contents. |
| `force-fieldtrials` | Can be used to force field trials when testing changes locally.  The argument is a list of name/value pairs, separated by forward slashes.  If a trial name is prefixed with an asterisk, that trial will start activated.  For example, the following argument defines two trials, with the second one activated: `EdgeNow/Enable/*MaterialDesignNTP/Default/`.  This option can also be used by the browser process to send the list of trials to a non-browser process, using the same format. |
| `force-fieldtrial-params` | Can be used to force parameters of field trials when testing changes locally.  The argument is a parameter list of (key, value) pairs, prefixed by an associated (trial, group) pair.  For multiple (trial, group) pairs, use a comma separator. |
| `force-renderer-accessibility` | Whether to force renderer accessibility to be on, instead of enabling renderer accessibility on-demand when a screen reader is detected.  The `disable-renderer-accessibility` flag overrides this flag, if the `disable-renderer-accessibility` flag is present. |
| `ignore-certificate-errors` | Ignores certificate-related errors. |
| `ignore-gpu-blocklist` | Whether to ignore the GPU blocklist. |
| `incognito` | Forces Incognito mode even if user data directory is specified by using the `--user-data-dir` flag. |
| `isolate-origins` | Require dedicated processes for a set of origins, specified as a comma-separated list. For example: --isolate-origins=https://www.foo.com,https://www.bar.com. |
| `js-flags` | Specifies the flags passed to JS engine. |
| `lang` | The language file that WebView2 want to try to open. Of the form language[-country] where language is the 2-letter code from ISO-639. |
| `log-net-log` | Enables saving net log events to a file.  If a value is given, that value is used as the directory path and file name.  If no value is given, the file is named `netlog.json`, and is placed in the user data directory. |
| `msAbydos` | Enables the "handwriting-to-text" experience. |
| `msAbydosGestureSupport` | Allows users to use gestures (such as the scratchout gesture) to delete text by using a pen.  Valid only if the `msAbydos` flag is enabled. |
| `msAbydosHandwritingAttr` | Whether the "handwriting-to-text" experience is enabled for input elements at the DOM level.  Valid only if the `msAbydos` flag is enabled. |
| `msEdgeFluentOverlayScrollbar` | Force-enables Fluent Overlay scrollbars, overriding whatever value `kFluentScrollbar` may hold at the moment. |
| `msEnhancedTextContrast` | Improves text contrast enhancement and gamma correction to match the quality and clarity of other native Windows applications.  When this flag is used, font rendering respects user ClearType Tuner settings when applying text contrast enhancement and gamma correction. |
| `msEnhancedTrackingPreventionEnabled` | Enables native privacy protection features, such as blocking cookies and web requests that reside in domains that are known to be tracking domains. |
| `msOverlayScrollbarWinStyle` | Whether the users can change between overlay and non-overlay modes for Fluent scrollbars. |
| `msPdfEnableAsPreview` | This features enables the PDF viewer to launch with a minimal toolbar and in read-only preview mode. |
| `msSmartScreenProtection` | If enabled, SmartScreen protection will be available. |
| `msWebView2TextureStream` | If enabled, allows to stream captured or composed video frames to the WebView2 where JavaScript can render or otherwise interact with the frames via W3C standard DOM APIs including the Video element, and MediaStream. |
| `msWebView2EnableDraggableRegions` | This flag enables webpages within WebView2 make use of the app-region: drag/nodrag CSS style which causes elements with that style to behave like a titlebar.  Without this flag, the style has no effect. |
| `msWebView2CodeCache` | If enabled, JavaScript resources that are loaded in a WebView2 app via `SetVirtualHostNameToFolderMapping` or `add_WebResourceRequested` are eligible for bytecode caching, which should speed up the third and subsequent loads.  This feature also enables bytecode caching for any other components that use the DevTools network interception mechanism to provide custom responses. |
| `no-proxy-server` | Overrides any other proxy server flags that are passed. |
| `net-log-capture-mode` | Sets the granularity of events to capture in the network log.  Valid values: `Default`, `IncludeSensitive`, `Everything`. |
| `no-sandbox` | Disables the sandbox for all process types that are normally sandboxed.  Meant to be used as a browser-level flag for testing purposes only. |
| `no-first-run` | Skips First-Run tasks, regardless of whether it's actually the First Run, and skips displaying the What's New page.  This flag is overridden by `kForceFirstRun` (for the First-Run Experience (FRE)) and by `kForceWhatsNew` (for displaying What's New).  This flag doesn't drop the First Run sentinel, and thus doesn't prevent the First-Run experience from occurring the next time the Edge WebView browser is launched without this flag.  This flag doesn't update the last What's New milestone, so doesn't prevent What's New from being displayed the next time the Edge WebView browser is launched without this flag. |
| `PartitionedCookies` | When enabled, sites can opt-in to having their cookies partitioned by the top-level site by using the `Partitioned` attribute.  Partitioned cookies are only sent when the browser is on the same top-level site that it was on when the cookie was set. |
| `proxy-auto-detect` | Forces proxy auto-detection. |
| `proxy-bypass-list` | A list of hosts for which proxy settings are bypassed; the specified hosts then use direct connections instead.  This flag is ignored unless `--proxy-server` is also specified.  Multiple hosts can be supplied as a comma-separated list. |
| `proxy-server` | A proxy server that overrides system settings.  This flag only affects HTTP and HTTPS requests. |
| `remote-allow-origins` | Enables web socket connections from the specified origins only.  The '*' wildcard allows any origin. |
| `remote-debugging-port` | Enables remote debugging over HTTP on the specified port. |
| `RendererAppContainer` | Enables Renderer `AppContainer`. |
| `Restart` | Indicates that Microsoft Edge WebView2 browser process was restarted (such as after a flag change).  Use this flag to ignore the launch when recording the `Launch.Mode2` metric. |
| `sdsm-state` | The "Super Duper Secure Mode" state.  Valid values: `off`, `basic`, `balanced`, `strict`. |
| `SharedArrayBuffer` | If enabled, indicates that a `SharedArrayBuffer` thread is present. |
| `ThirdPartyStoragePartitioning` | Enables partitioning of third-party storage, such as `IndexedDB` or `CacheStorage`, by the top-level site, to reduce fingerprinting. |
| `unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` | Treats given (insecure) origins as secure origins.  Multiple origins can be specified, as a comma-separated list.  For the definition of secure contexts, see [Secure Contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/), including the section [Is `origin` potentially trustworthy?](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy).  Example: `--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://a.test,http://b.test` |
| `use-fake-device-for-media-stream` | Uses a fake device for Media Stream to replace an actual camera and microphone. |
| `use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` | Bypasses the media stream infobar, by selecting the default device for media streams (such as WebRTC).  Works with `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`.  Prefer using `--auto-accept-camera-and-microphone-capture` instead, which doesn't interact with screen capture, such as capturing a browser tab. |
| `use-system-proxy-resolver` | Uses WinHttp to resolve proxies instead of using WebView2's normal proxy resolution logic.  This flag is only supported in Windows. |
| `user-agent` | A string used to override the default user agent with a custom user agent. |
| `user-data-migrated` | Indicates that this process is the product of a relaunch following migration of user data. |
| `V8Maglev` | Enables the Maglev compiler.  This only sets the V8 flag when manually overridden; otherwise, it defers to whatever the V8 default is. |
