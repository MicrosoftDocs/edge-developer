# Navigation events for WebView2

Supported platforms: Win32, Windows Forms, WinUi, WPF.

Navigation events run when specific asynchronous actions occur to the content that's displayed in a WebView2 instance.  For example, when a WebView2 user navigates to a new website, the native content listens for the change by listening for the `NavigationStarting` event.  When the navigation action completes, `NavigationCompleted` runs.  For an example of navigation events, see a platform-specific [Get started](../index.md#get-started) article.

<!--todo:  Move the relevant information out of the get started guide to better focus the content and leave the most concise elements in the get started guide.  -->

The normal sequence of navigation events is:
1. `NavigationStarting`
1. `SourceChanged`
1. `ContentLoading`
1. `HistoryChanged`
1. `DOMContentLoaded`
1. `NavigationCompleted`

The following events describe the state of WebView2 during each navigation action:

| Sequence | Event name | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `NavigationStarting` |  WebView2 starts to navigate and the navigation results in a network request.  The host may disallow the request during the event. |
| 2 | `SourceChanged` |  The source of WebView2 changes to a new URL.  The event may result from a navigation action that does not cause a network request such as a fragment navigation. |
| 3 | `ContentLoading` |  WebView2 starts loading content for the new page. |
| 4 | `HistoryChanged` |  The navigation causes the history of WebView2 to update. |
| 5 | `DOMContentLoaded` |  WebView2 finishes parsing the DOM content but hasn't finished loading all images, script, and other content on the page. |
| 6 | `NavigationCompleted` |  WebView2 completes loading content on the new page. |

The above figure shows navigation events that have the same `NavigationId` property on the respective event argument.

Track navigation events to each new document by using the navigation ID (which is provided in the `NavigationId` event).  The `NavigationId` event of WebView2 changes every time a successful navigation to a new document completes.

Navigation events with different instances of `NavigationId` event may overlap.  For instance, when you start a navigation event, you must wait for the related `NavigationStarting` event.  If you then start another navigation, you'll see the following sequence:
1. The `NavigationStarting` event for the first navigation.
1. The `NavigationStarting` event for the second navigation.
1. The `NavigationCompleted` event for the first navigation.
1. All the rest of the appropriate navigation events for the second navigation.

In error cases, there may or may not be a `ContentLoading` event, depending on whether the navigation is continued to an error page.

If an HTTP redirect occurs, there are multiple `NavigationStarting` events in a row, where later event arguments have the `IsRedirect` property set; however, the `NavigationId` event remains the same.

Same-document navigation events, such as navigating to a fragment in the same document, don't cause a `NavigationStarting` event, and don't increment the `NavigationId` event.

To monitor or cancel navigation events inside subframes in a WebView2 instance, use the `FrameNavigationStarting` and `FrameNavigationCompleted` events.  Those events act like the equivalent non-frame, counterpart events.
