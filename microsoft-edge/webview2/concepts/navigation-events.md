# Navigation events  

The normal sequence of navigation events is `NavigationStarting`, `SourceChanged`, `ContentLoading`, `HistoryChanged`, and then `NavigationCompleted`.  The following events describe the state of WebView2 during each navigation.  

| Sequence | Event name | Details |  
|:--- |:--- |:--- |  
| 1 | `NavigationStarting`  |  WebView2 starts to navigate and the navigation results in a network request.  The host is able to disallow the request during the event.  |  
| 2 | `SourceChanged`  |  The source of WebView2 changes to a new URL.  The event may result from a navigation that does not cause a network request such as a fragment navigation.  |  
| 3 | `HistoryChanged`  |  The history of WebView2 updates as a result of the navigation.  |  
| 4 | `ContentLoading`  |  WebView starts loading content for the new page.  |  
| 5 | `NavigationCompleted`  |  WebView2 completes loading content on the new page.  |  

Track `navigations` to each new document using the navigation ID \(`NavigationId`\).  The `NavigationId` of WebView changes every time there is a successful navigation to a new document.

> [!NOTE]
> The previous figure represents navigation events with the same `NavigationId` property on the respective event arg.  

 `Navigations` events with different instances of `NavigationId` event may overlap.  For instance when you start a navigation, you have to wait for the related `NavigationStarting` event.  If you then start another navigation, you should see the `NavigationStarting` event for the first navigate followed by the `NavigationStarting` event for the second navigate, followed by the `NavigationCompleted` event for the first navigation and then all the rest of the appropriate navigation events for the second navigation.  
 
 In error cases there may or may not be a `ContentLoading` event depending on whether the navigation is continued to an error page.  
 
 In the case of an HTTP redirect, there are multiple `NavigationStarting` events in a row, where subsequent event args have the `IsRedirect` property set, however the `NavigationId` remains the same.  
 
 Same document `navigations`, such as navigating to a fragment, do not result in the `NavigationStarting` event and do not increment the `NavigationId`.  

To monitor or cancel `navigations` inside subframes in the WebView, use the `FrameNavigationStarting` and the `FrameNavigationCompleted` events which act just like the equivalent non-frame counterpart events.
