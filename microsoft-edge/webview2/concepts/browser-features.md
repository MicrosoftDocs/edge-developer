# Feature differences between Microsoft Edge and WebView2

WebView2 is based on the Microsoft Edge browser.  You have the opportunity to extend features from the browser to WebView2-based apps, which is useful.  However, since WebView2 isn't limited to browser-like apps, there are some browser features that need to be modified or removed.  This article provides the following information.

*   The modified browser features and supporting information.
*   The ability to turn on or off the feature.
*   Guidance on keyboard shortcuts.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Design guidelines

In the context of WebView2, browser features adhere to the following design guidelines.

*   Most features work the same in WebView2 and Microsoft Edge.  If a feature doesn't make sense in the context of WebView2 or for other reasons, the feature is modified or turned off.
*   WebView2 features don't include Microsoft Edge branding.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Browser features

The following table displays the WebView2 features that differ from the Microsoft Edge browser.

*   **Default state** indicates that the feature is part of the default experience on a new WebView2 instance.
*   **Configurable** indicates that you can turn on or off the feature using WebView2 APIs or command-line switches.

> [!NOTE]
> This article doesn't cover modifying features using command-line switches.  For more information about turning on and off features with command-line switches, see [List of Chromium Command Line Switches](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches).

| Feature | Default state | Configurable | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Autofill for Addresses | On | Yes | This feature is turned on by default.  You can turn this feature on or off by using the WebView2 Autofill APIs. |
| Autofill for Passwords | On | Yes | This feature is turned on by default.  You can turn this feature on or off by using the WebView2 Autofill APIs. |
| Autofill for Payments | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Browser Extensions | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Browser Task Manager | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Collections | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Continue-where-I-left-off prompt | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Downloads | On | Yes | WebView2 provides an API that allows you to customize the download UI to manipulate downloads. For example, you can block, redirect, save, pause, and so on.  For more information, see [Download API](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2_4?view=webview2-1.0.902-prerelease&preserve-view=true#add_downloadstarting). |
| Edge Shopping | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Family Safety | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Favorites | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| IE Mode | Off | No | This feature is turned off. WebView2 doesn't support IE mode and has differences in behavior compared to IE (such as MHT or BIN support). |
| Immersive Reader | Off | No | This feature depends on the browser UI for interaction.  This feature is turned off. |
| Intrusive Ads | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Review Details | Review Details | The keyboard shortcuts that are turned off by default either don't make sense or cause problems in WebView2.  You cannot turn these shortcuts off or on.  Instead, you can listen for a key combination using the `AcceleratorKeyPressed` event and create a custom response if needed.  For more information, see [Additional keyboard shortcuts information](#additional-keyboard-shortcuts-information). |
| PDF Annotations | Off | No | This feature is turned off. The PDF viewing feature is enabled, but drawing, inking, and highlighting in a PDF are not enabled. For more information, see [Disabling Feature: PDF Annotations Support](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Announcements/issues/21). |
| Read Aloud | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Smart Screen | On`*` | No | `*` The UI for this feature has been removed, however the underlying functionality is still available.  Additionally, you can turn off Smart Screen by using a command-line switch. |
| Translate | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| Tracking Prevention | On`*` | No | `*` The UI for this feature has been removed, however the underlying functionality is still available.  Tracking prevention is always set to balanced. |
| Profile and Identity | Off | No | The feature that syncs your favorites, cookies, and so on, is turned off. |
| Windows Defender Application Guard | Off | No | This feature is turned off. |
| edge:// URLs | Review Details | No | Settings for the Microsoft Edge browser are on `edge://` URLs.  Because most of these webpages have Microsoft Edge branding or don't make sense within the context of WebView2, some of these URLs are turned off.  For more information, see [Blocked internal URLs](#blocked-internal-urls). |


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Web platform features

The following table displays the WebView2 platform features that are currently unavailable.

| Feature | Details |
|:--- | :--- |
| Push Notifications | This feature is not implemented in WebView2. |
| Web Payment API | This feature is turned off. |


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Blocked internal URLs

The following Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome settings webpages aren't available in WebView2.

*   `chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html`
*   `edge://application-guard-internals`
*   `edge://apps`
*   `edge://compat`
*   `edge://extensions`

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Additional keyboard shortcuts information

Keyboard shortcuts or key bindings are supported in Microsoft Edge and WebView2.  When Microsoft Edge is updated, the default key bindings might change.  Furthermore, a keyboard shortcut that is turned off by default might instead be turned on, if the feature is now supported in WebView2.  To avoid such changes to your keyboard shortcuts, you can set `AreBrowserAcceleratorKeysEnabled` to `FALSE`, which turns off all keys that access browser features, but keeps all basic text-editing and movement shortcuts turned on.

The following shortcuts are always turned off in WebView2.  An asterisk (`*`) indicates that the shortcut isn't turned off, but the feature that it accesses is turned off, or the feature doesn't apply to WebView2.
