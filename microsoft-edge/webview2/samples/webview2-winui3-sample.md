# WinUI 3 sample app

This sample demonstrates using a WebView2 control in a WinUI 3 Windows SDK Packaged application.

* Sample name: **WebView2_WinUI3_Sample**
* Repo folder: [WebView2_WinUI3_Sample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WebView2_WinUI3_Sample)
* Solution file: `SampleApps/WebView2_WinUI3_Sample/WebView2_WinUI3_Sample.sln`

This sample also shows how to optionally update the application to ship packaged together with a fixed version of the WebView2 Runtime, instead of using the version of the WebView2 Runtime that's installed on the user's computer.

This sample was created using Visual Studio 2022.  To build and run this sample, see the [Readme](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WebView2_WinUI3_Sample#readme).

<!-- 1. In Visual Studio 2022, open the solution file.
