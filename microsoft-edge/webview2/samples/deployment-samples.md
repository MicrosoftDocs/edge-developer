# Deployment samples

For each deployment sample in the WebView2Samples repo, there's an article in the regular docs, as well as a Readme, directory, and (if appropriate) a project file in the repo.

| Article | Sample |
|---|---|
| [WebView2 Deployment Visual Studio installer](wv2deploymentvsinstallersample.md) | [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample) |
| [WiX Burn Bundle to deploy the Runtime](wv2deploymentwixburnbundlesample.md) | [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample) |
