#### Sample apps vs. completed Getting Started tutorials

The sample apps are the source of the sample code snippets that are shown in the API Reference docs and conceptual docs.

For some frameworks or platforms, the samples repo contains both a completed Getting Started tutorial and a sample app.  These sample apps showcase more of the WebView2 APIs than the Getting Started tutorials.
