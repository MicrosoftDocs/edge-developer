# WebView2 sample code

The following WebView2 samples are available in the Get Started guides for WebView2 and in the [WebView2 Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Sample code for Get Started guides

The WebView2 Get Started guides use starter code for Win32, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), WinForms, and WinUI.

| Platform | Article | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Win32 | [Get started with WebView2 in Win32 apps](./get-started/win32.md) | Starter code at [WebView2 Samples Win32 Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/Win32_GettingStarted) |
| WPF | [Get started with WebView2 in WPF apps](./get-started/wpf.md) | .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WPF Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WPF_GettingStarted) |
| WinForms | [Get started with WebView2 in WinForms apps](./get-started/winforms.md) | .NET starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinForms Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinForms_GettingStarted) |
| WinUI 3 | [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK)](./get-started/winui.md) | Starter code at [WebView2 Samples WinUI Getting Started (github.com)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/GettingStartedGuides/WinUI3_GettingStarted) |
| WinUI 2 | [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 2 apps guide](./get-started/winui2.md) | Uses the WinUI 2 NuGet package.  Has no sample code. |

## Apps in the WebView2 Samples repo

The [WebView2 Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples) includes sample projects for Win32, WPF, WinForms, and WinUI.  These samples are hybrid applications that use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 control.

Clone the WebView2 Samples repo and then open the solution file [WebView2Samples.sln](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2Samples.sln) in Microsoft Visual Studio.  When you open the solution file in Visual Studio, **Solution Explorer** contains the following WebView2 samples, as projects:

The WebView2 Samples repo contains the following projects, in `WebView2Samples.sln`:

| Type of sample | Sample Project | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Win32 C++ | [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample) | Embeds a WebView2 within a Win32 native application.  Illustrates a selection of WebView2 event handlers and API methods that allow a native Win32 application to directly interact with a WebView and vice versa.<br/><br/>  Built as a Win32 project in [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).  Uses C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment. |
| Win32 C++ with Visual Composition | [WebView2SampleWinComp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2SampleWinComp) | Embeds a WebView2 within a Win32 native application.  Uses [Windows Runtime Composition APIs](/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition), also called the Visual layer, to take advantage of the latest Windows 10 or later UI features and create better look, feel, and functionality in C++ Win32 applications.<br/><br/>  Built as a Win32 project in Visual Studio 2019.  Uses C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment. |
| WinForms | [WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser) | Embeds a WebView2 within a Windows Forms application.<br/><br/>  Built as a Windows Forms project in Visual Studio 2019.  Uses C# and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment. |
| Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) .NET | [WebView2WpfBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WebView2WpfBrowser) | Embeds a WebView2 within a WPF application.<br/><br/>  Built as a WPF project in Visual Studio 2019.  Uses C# and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment. |
| Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) in WPF | [WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/master/SampleApps/WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample) | Uses Chrome [DevTools Protocol](../devtools-protocol-chromium\index.md) functions using a `DevToolsProtocolHelper` object in WebView2.  Demonstrates the usage patterns of the WebView2 CDP extension in WPF.  This application is built with the [WebView2 CDP Extension](https://aka.ms/webviewcdp) that defines all CDP methods, events, and types.<br/><br/>  Built as a WPF project in Visual Studio 2019.  Uses C# in the WebView2 environment. |
| WiX Burn Bundle to deploy Runtime | [WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXBurnBundleSample/README.md) | Creates a [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) installer for the [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and uses [WiX Burn Bundle](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/bundle/) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.<br/><br/>  Used when deploying the [Evergreen WebView2 Runtime](concepts/distribution.md) with your app. |
| WiX Custom Action to deploy Runtime | [WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentWiXCustomActionSample/README.md) | Creates a WiX installer for the `WebView2APISample` and uses [WiX Custom Action](https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/wixdev/extensions/authoring_custom_actions.html) to chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.<br/><br/>  Used when deploying the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime with your app. |

## UWP/WinUI samples

A comprehensive API sample for UWP/WinUI is available from the [WinUI Controls Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview).

This WinUI Controls Gallery sample shows all of the XAML controls in an interactive format.  This app is the interactive companion to the [Fluent Design Guidelines](/windows/uwp/design/basics/) and shows the usage of both UWP XAML APIs and [Windows UI Toolkit](/uwp/toolkits/winui/) APIs.

## Deploy the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime

The [WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WV2DeploymentVSInstallerSample/README.md) uses the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) extension for Visual Studio, to create an installer for [WebView2APISample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/blob/master/SampleApps/WebView2APISample/README.md) and chain-install the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime.

This sample is a separate installer. It's not part of the `WebView2Samples` repo.
