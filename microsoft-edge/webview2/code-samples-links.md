# Sample apps

Sample apps that use WebView2 are available in the [WebView2Samples repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps), for various frameworks or platforms.

| Framework or platform | Article | Sample in repo | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| WinUI 2 (UWP) | [WinUI 2 (UWP) sample app](samples/webview2_sample_uwp.md) | [webview2_sample_uwp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/webview2_sample_uwp) | &nbsp; |
| WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK) | n/a | n/a | [Tutorial](get-started/winui.md).<br/> [Completed tutorial project](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/GettingStartedGuides/WinUI3_GettingStarted). |
| WPF | [WPF sample app](samples/webview2wpfbrowser.md) | [WebView2WpfBrowser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WebView2WpfBrowser) | &nbsp; |
| WPF with CDP | [WPF app with CDP extension](samples/wv2cdpextensionwpfsample.md) | [WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/SampleApps/WV2CDPExtensionWPFSample) | &nbsp; |

These articles provide the specific steps to set up your machine and build, run, and update each sample.


#### Sample apps vs. completed Getting Started tutorials

The sample apps are the source of the sample code snippets that are shown in the API Reference docs and conceptual docs.

For some frameworks or platforms, the samples repo contains both a completed Getting Started tutorial and a sample app.  These sample apps showcase more of the WebView2 APIs than the Getting Started tutorials.


#### Installed SDK package versions

Typically, for these samples, you do the following sequence:
1.  Build and run the sample as-is from the repo.
1.  Update the sample's project's packages, such as the WebView2 prerelease SDK.  The prerelease SDK allows you to try the latest APIs.
1.  Build and run the sample using the updated SDK packages.
