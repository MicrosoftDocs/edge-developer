#  Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) extensions

Extensions are small programs that you can use to add new features to Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) or to modify the existing functionality. Extensions are intended to improve a userâ€™s day-to-day browsing experience by providing niche functionality that's important to targeted audiences.

Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) supports a new extension model that's based on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The new extension model is Chrome-compatible. Chrome extension developers can migrate their extensions to Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) with minimal changes.

## Get started
