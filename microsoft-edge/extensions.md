#  Microsoft Edge extensions

Extensions are small programs that can be used to add new features to Microsoft Edge or modify the existing functionality. Extensions are intended to improve a user’s day-to-day browsing experience by providing niche functionality that is important to targeted audiences.

Microsoft Edge supports a new HTML, JavaScript and CSS based extension model. This new model is Chrome-compatible which means that existing Chrome extension developers will be able to migrate their extensions to Edge with minimal changes.

To get a an overview of the end to end journey of creating an Edge extension from development to publishing, check out the [Getting started guide](./extensions/getting-started.md)!
