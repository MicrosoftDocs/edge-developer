---#  Microsoft Edge ExtensionsExtensions are small programs that can be used to add new features to Microsoft Edge or modify the existing functionality. Extensions are intended to improve a user’s day-to-day browsing experience by providing niche functionality that is important to targeted audiences.Microsoft Edge supports a new HTML, JavaScript and CSS based extension model. This new model is Chrome-compatible which means that existing Chrome extension developers will be able to migrate their extensions to Microsoft Edge with minimal changes.
