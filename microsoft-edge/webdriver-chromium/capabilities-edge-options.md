# Capabilities and EdgeOptions

Capabilities are options that you can use to customize and configure an `EdgeDriver` session.  To learn about starting a new `EdgeDriver` session, navigate to [Automating Microsoft Edge](./index.md#automate-microsoft-edge).  This article describes all supported capabilities for Microsoft Edge and provides details about passing the capabilities to `EdgeDriver` sessions.

Capabilities are passed to a WebDriver session as a JSON map.  A WebDriver testing framework provides a WebDriver language binding.  WebDriver language bindings typically provide type-safe convenience methods so you don't need to configure the JSON map yourself.  Different WebDriver language bindings use different mechanisms to configure capabilities.  [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) configures capabilities through the `EdgeOptions` class.

To learn more about how to configure capabilities, consult the documentation for your preferred WebDriver testing framework.  For more information, navigate to [Choose a WebDriver testing framework](./index.md#choose-a-webdriver-testing-framework).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Using the EdgeOptions class

Create an instance of `EdgeOptions`, which provides convenience methods to set Microsoft Edge-specific capabilities.  After you configure the `EdgeOptions` object, pass `EdgeOptions` into the `EdgeDriver` constructor.

```csharp
var options = new EdgeOptions();
options.AddExtensions("/path/to/extension.crx");
var driver = new EdgeDriver(options);
```

To use capabilities that don't have an associated convenience method, use the `AddAdditionalCapability` method.  You must pass the full name of the capability and a value with the correct type.  To review the full list of accepted capabilities and value types, navigate to [EdgeOptions object](#edgeoptions-object).

```csharp
options.AddAdditionalCapability("wdpAddress", "remotehost:50080");
```


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Recognized Capabilities

For standard capabilities that `EdgeDriver` accepts, navigate to [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/driver_idiosyncrasies/shared_capabilities/) and the [W3C WebDriver standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver#capabilities).  This article only lists capabilities specific to Microsoft Edge.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## EdgeOptions object

Most Microsoft Edge-specific capabilities are exposed through the `EdgeOptions` object.  In some languages, the capabilities are implemented by the `EdgeOptions` class.  In other languages, the capabilities are stored under the `ms:edgeOptions` dictionary in `DesiredCapabilities`.

| Capability | Type | Default value | Details |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| args | list of strings |  | List of command-line arguments to use when starting Microsoft Edge.  Arguments with an associated value should be separated by a `=` sign (for example, `['start-maximized', 'user-data-dir=/tmp/temp_profile']`). |
| binary | string |  | Path to the Microsoft Edge binary to use (on macOS, the path should be the actual binary, not just the app.  for example, `/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge`). |
| debuggerAddress | string |  | An address of a debugger server to which to connect, in the form of `hostname/ip:port`, for example `127.0.0.1:38947`. |
| detach | boolean | `false` | If `false`, Microsoft Edge quits when the WebDriver service shuts down, even if the WebDriver local end hasn't closed the session.  If `true`, Microsoft Edge only quits if the WebDriver local end closes the session.  If `true`, and the WebDriver local end does not close the session, `EdgeDriver` does not clean up the temporary user data folder used by the Microsoft Edge instance. |
| excludeSwitches | list of strings |  | List of Microsoft Edge command line switches to exclude that EdgeDriver by default passes when starting Microsoft Edge.  Avoid the `--` prefix for switches. |
| extensions | list of strings |  | A list of extensions to install on startup.  Each item in the list should be a base-64 encoded packed extension (`.crx`). |
| localState | dictionary |  | A dictionary with each entry consisting of the name of the preference and the value.  The preferences are applied to the Local State file in the user data folder. |
| minidumpPath | string |  | Directory to store Microsoft Edge minidumps.  (Supported only on Linux.) |
| mobileEmulation | dictionary |  | A dictionary with either a value for `deviceName`, or values for `deviceMetrics` and `userAgent`. |
| perfLoggingPrefs | dictionary |  | An optional dictionary that specifies performance logging preferences.  for more information, navigate to [perfLoggingPrefs object](#perfloggingprefs-object). |
| prefs | dictionary |  | A dictionary with each entry consisting of the name of the preference and the value.  The preferences are only applied to the user profile in use.  For examples, navigate to the `Preferences` file in the user data folder of Microsoft Edge. |
| wdpAddress | string |  | An address of a Windows Device Portal server to which you connect, in the form of `hostname/ip:port`, for example  `127.0.0.1:50080`.  For more information, navigate to [Remote Debugging - Windows 10 devices](../devtools-guide-chromium/remote-debugging/windows.md). |
| wdpPassword | string |  | Optional password to use when connecting to a Windows Device Portal server.  Required if the server has authentication enabled. |
| wdpUsername | string |  | Optional user name to use when connecting to a Windows Device Portal server.  Required if the server has authentication enabled. |
| windowsApp | string |  | Application user model ID of a Microsoft Edge app package to launch, for example `Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge.Stable_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MSEDGE`.  Use `windowsApp` instead of `binary` when connecting to a Windows 10X device or emulator using Windows Device Portal. |
| windowTypes | list of strings |  | A list of window types that are displayed in the list of window handles.  For access to Android webview elements, include `webview` in the list. |


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## perfLoggingPrefs object

The `perfLoggingPrefs` dictionary has the following format (all keys are optional).

| Key | Type | Default value | Details |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| bufferUsageReportingInterval | positive integer | 1000 | The requested number of milliseconds between DevTools trace buffer usage events.  For example, if 1000, then once per second, DevTools reports how full the trace buffer is.  If a report indicates the buffer usage is 100%, a warning is issued. |
| enableNetwork | boolean | true | To collect (or not collect) events from Network domain. |
| enablePage | boolean | true | To collect (or not collect) events from Page domain. |
| traceCategories | string | (empty) | A comma-separated string of Microsoft Edge tracing categories for which trace events should be collected.  An unspecified or empty string disables tracing. |


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Returned capabilities

The following list contains all of the Microsoft Edge-specific capabilities that `EdgeDriver` returns when you create a new session.

| Capability | Type | Details |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| msedge.msedgedriverVersion | string | The version of EdgeDriver. |
| msedge.userDataDir | string | The path to the user data folder used by the Microsoft Edge instance. |
