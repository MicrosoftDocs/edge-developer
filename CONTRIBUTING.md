# Contributing to Microsoft Edge documentation

We welcome your contributions to the [Microsoft Edge developer guide](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/f12-devtools-guide/), [(opensource content)](./dev-guide), and [F12 tool documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/f12-devtools-guide/), [(opensource content)](./f12-devtools-guide)! You will need a GitHub user account to contribute to the documentation. Currently the GitHub directory structure parallels the table of contents on the site. There are several ways you can contribute to the docs:

## Reporting bugs or issues in the docs
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MicrosoftEdge-Documentation/issues) if you come across outdated or inaccurate information in docs. A documentation editorial team will review and address issues, however, you can also take a crack at fixing any issues you find on your own! Follow the steps for updating documentation below... when you are contributing changes to address an issue, please be sure to reference the issue in your commit message, just use #issueNumber or copy-paste the issue URL.  

Visit the [Feedback & Support](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/community/support/) page for other FAQs, to request a new Microsoft Edge feature, to file a bug related to Microsoft Edge (the browser, rather than the documentation), or for a link to follow @MSEdgeDev on twitter.

## Updating documentation
Microsoft Edge documentation is written in [GitHub Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) and all contributions will be be covered by the [Creative Commons license](./LICENSE.md). Begin by [forking this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your GitHub account. Clone the forked repository to your local machine. Add, tweak, reword and even remove any content that you believe should be updated. Push the changes to your forked repository and then initiate a pull request with a description of your changes. The documentation editorial team will review your work and may accept all of your changes, only portions of you changes, or may contact you with questions about your suggested changes before accepting.

Thank you for contributing to the Microsoft Edge docs!
