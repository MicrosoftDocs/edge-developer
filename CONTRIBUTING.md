1.  When you are done, commit your changes and open a pull request.

After you create the pull request, the Microsoft Edge Developer Docs team reviews it.  If your pull request is approved, updates are published to [Microsoft Edge Developer documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/developer/).

## Making more substantial changes

To make substantial changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, the Microsoft Edge team recommends forking the repo into your GitHub account, and then creating a local clone.

1. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the [edge-developer repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer).

2. Click the green **Clone or download** button, copy to your clipboard, then run the following code at your command prompt:

   ```Shell
   git clone {paste_your_repo_clone_link}
   ```
   
For more info, see [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Authoring your contribution

After you have cloned the repo to your local machine, begin authoring with the text editor of your choice.  The Microsoft Edge team recommends [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a free lightweight open-source code editor and integrated development environment from Microsoft.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Submitting your contribution and filing a Pull Request (PR)

After you are ready to add your changes to the remote repo so that the changes are staged for publishing, enter the following code in the command-line.

| Step | Command | Details |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| 1 | `git status` | This command displays the files you have changed so that you can confirm that you intended to make those changes. |
| 2 | `git add -A` | This command tells git to add all of your changes.  If you prefer to only add the changes you have made to one particular file, instead enter the command: `git add {file.md}`, where `file.md` represents the name the file containing your changes. |
| 3 | `git commit -m "Fixed a few typos"` | This command tells git to commit the changes that you added in the previous step, along with a short message describing the changes that you made. |
| 4 | `git push origin {your_branch_name}` | This command pushes your changes to the remote repo that you forked on GitHub (the `origin`) into the branch that you have specified.  Because you have forked the repo to your own GitHub account, you are welcome to do your work in the `main` branch. |

When you are happy with your changes and ready to submit a PR:

1.  Go to your fork of the `edge-developer` repo:

    ```https
    https://github.com/{your_github_alias}/edge-developer
    ```

1.  Click the **New pull request** button.  (The `base fork` is listed as `MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer`, the `head fork` should show your fork of the repo, and the branch in which you made your changes.)  You can review your changes here as well.

1.  Click the green **Create pull request** button.  Give your Pull Request a title and description, then click the **Create pull request** button again.

1.  After pushing your contribution to the remote repo, you receive an email from **Open Publishing Build Service** indicating whether your commit built successfully.  The email contains links to any errors or warnings, such as broken links.  Click the **View** links to see your content staged on the `review.docs.microsoft.com` site.

1.  After your PR is submitted, the Microsoft Edge Developer Docs team reviews the PR, approves the PR, merges the PR into the `main` branch, and then merges the PR's commits into the `live` branch.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Working with Branches

When making contributions, submit your Pull Request (PR), requesting to merge from your working branch (such as a branch in your forked copy of the repo) into the `main` branch of the `edge-developer` repo.

The [Microsoft Edge Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer) uses the following two main parent branches:

| Branch  | Details  |
|:--- |:--- |
| [main](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/tree/main)  | The content in the `main` branch has been internally reviewed. |
| [live](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer/tree/live)  |  The content in the `live` branch has been published on the [live site](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge). |

The series of branches is as follows:

1. Fork the `edge-developer` repo, using GitHub.com.

1. Create a working branch and make your changes there, rather than making your changes in the `main` branch of a fork of the repo.  It works OK, though, if you do end up using the `main` branch of a fork of the repo.

1. Edit a `.md` file.  If you create a new `.md` file, add it to `toc.yml`.

1. Push your commits up to the repo at GitHub.com.

1. Create a PR at GitHub.com, requesting to merge the commits from your working branch into the `main` branch of the `edge-developer` repo.

1. The Microsoft Edge Developer Docs team reviews the PR, approves the PR, and then merges the PR's commits from the PR's working branch into the `main` branch of the `edge-developer` repo.

1. The Microsoft Edge Developer Docs team merges commits from the `main` branch into the `live` branch of the `edge-developer` repo.

1. The build process publishes the PR's commits at the public site, [Microsoft Edge Developer documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/developer/).
